<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1</span><i>HISTORY</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> carelessness which in many
instances is evident in the orthography of our ancestors,
frequently renders it matter of extreme difficulty to fix, with
accuracy and precision, the etymology of places which in early
times were conspicuous for the parts they bore in our national
transactions.</p>
<p>This is in some measure the situation of Shrewsbury, which by
the ancient Welsh was called Ymwithig, or &ldquo;the
Delight;&rdquo; by the Britons Pengwern; and by the Saxons
Scrobbesbyrig; the two latter names signifying nearly the same,
&ldquo;the Head of the Alder Groves.&rdquo;&nbsp; But it is
probable that the Normans after their conquest of the Island,
either from inability to pronounce the harsher Saxon words, or
from the spirit of innovation on the names and manners of the
inhabitants, generally possessed by conquerors, were induced to
soften the term into Shrobbesburie and Sloppesburie, from whence
were derived the modern names of Shrewsbury and Salop, in latin
Salopia.&nbsp; Some are inclined to think the latter name was
formed from the two Saxon words <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span><i>sel</i>, signifying pleasant, and
<i>hope</i>, the side of a hill, which certainly accords with its
situation.</p>
<p>Leland, the antiquary and poet, in his description of the
town, thus accounts for its name:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Built on a hill, fair Salop greets the eye,<br />
While Severn forms a crescent gliding by;<br />
Two bridges cross the navigable stream,<br />
And British Alders gave the town a name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although much doubt remains relative to the founder of
Shrewsbury, it is certain that &ldquo;it was repaired about the
year 552 by Maelgwyn, king of North Wales;&rdquo; and the most
probable conjecture is, that it was erected between the years 520
and 594 by the Britons, in order to protect themselves from the
bloody ravages and harrassing incursions of the Saxons who had
previously levelled the Roman Uriconium (the present Wroxeter)
and its fortress with the ground, and forced them to retreat
beyond the Severn, which then became the boundary of the kingdom
of Mercia.</p>
<p>The Britons having established themselves on the hill
Pengwerne, founded a city, which became the metropolis of that
part of Wales called Powis, one of the princes of which,
Brochwell Ysithroc, had his residence here in 617, and thence it
was named Pengwerne Powis.&mdash;The blood-thirsty spirit of
their Saxon invaders still pursued them: after several dreadful
and sanguinary contests with the merciless Offa, the British
Prince was at length compelled to abandon the patrimony of his
ancestors and retire to Mathrafal, amidst the mountains of
Montgomeryshire, after witnessing the destruction of his princely
mansion, which stood on the spot lately occupied by the church of
St. Chad; and finally, in 777, to surrender that part of the
country situated between the Severn and a deep dyke and high
rampart, extending <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>100 miles over roads and mountains and across deep
vallies and rivers, which Offa threw up as a new boundary between
them and Mercia.</p>
<p>In the reign of Alfred, Shrewsbury was numbered among the
British cities, by the name of Caer Pengwerne; and during that of
Edward the elder, a mint was established here, as appears from a
piece of coin now in preservation, with this inscription,
<i>Edward Rex Angli&aelig;</i>, and on the reverse <i>Aelmaer on
Scrobe</i>.</p>
<p>Ethelred, with his court, kept the Christmas of 1006 at
Shrewsbury, and being unable to resist the perpetual attacks of
the Danes, then invading England under Swaine, he summoned a
council here, by whose advice he paid &pound;30,000, to procure a
temporary and inglorious peace.&nbsp; About the same time
Alfhelm, a prince of the blood, was invited to a banquet here by
Edric, duke of Mercia and whilst hunting in the neighbourhood was
murdered by one Godwin Porthund, a butcher, at the instigation of
Edric, and from whence it is supposed arose the custom, recited
in Doomsday Book, that whenever the king was here, twelve of the
chief citizens should guard his person during his residence in
the city, and attend him when he enjoyed himself with the
pleasures of the chase.</p>
<p>In the year 1016, the inhabitants having revolted to Canute,
Edmund, afterwards, when king surnamed Ironside, marched quickly
hither from the north, and having taken the city, exercised every
species of cruelty on them as a punishment for their revolt.</p>
<p>No material transactions appear to have occurred in the annals
of Shrewsbury for nearly half a century, from the last named date
until the conquest of England by the Normans under William.&nbsp;
The city was then granted, together with nearly the whole of <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>the county and
a great proportion of land in other parts of the kingdom, to
Roger de Montgomery, a Norman chief related to William, and by
whom he was attended in his English expedition.&nbsp; Roger was
no sooner put in possession of his newly acquired property, than
being sensible of the advantages resulting from the situation of
the town, he constituted it the capital of his earldom, and fixed
his abode in it as lord paramount of the county; and having
judiciously built a castle on the isthmus, for the purpose of
protecting his residence from the attack of his enemies, with the
assistance of inferior barons of his court, administered various
solemn and kingly acts of justice, donation, and investiture
within its walls.&nbsp; Earl Roger was, however, not suffered to
enjoy the immense possessions bestowed on him by the Norman
conqueror without molestation: Owen Gwynedd, a spirited Welsh
chieftain, excited either by hopes of plunder or a desire to
dispossess the invaders, of a place which was capable of being
rendered a great annoyance to his countrymen in the hands of
powerful enemies, attacked it with a considerable body of Welsh;
and so important was his attack considered by William, that he
marched with a numerous army from the north, for the purpose of
repelling the daring disturber; nor did his usual good fortune
desert him in this instance, Owen being defeated and a great
portion of his followers slain.&nbsp; As a suitable
acknowledgment to divine providence for his good fortune and the
splendid triumphs of his arms, the Earl founded the benedictine
Abbey of St. Peter and St. Paul.&nbsp; A short time previous to
his death he was shorn a monk.&nbsp; He died July 27th, 1094, and
was buried in the chapel of the Abbey; over his tomb was placed
an armed knight in stone.</p>
<p>Robert de Belesme, son of Roger de Montgomery, <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>who succeeded
his brother Hugh the Red in the earldom of Shrewsbury, united
with the party who wished to seat Robert, duke of Normandy, on
the throne, in lieu of Henry the First; and on the coronation of
that monarch, openly rebelled against his authority, placing the
castle under the command of Roger de Corbet, and garrisoning it
with 80 soldiers.&nbsp; Henry immediately marched for Shrewsbury
at the head of 60,000 men, and threatening, if the town was not
delivered up to him in three days, to hang all he should find
therein, Robert surrendered, and sent the keys to the king by
Ralph, abbot of Seez, imploring his clemency: this was granted,
but Robert was banished to Normandy, his immense estates
forfeited, and the splendour of his baronial house for ever
extinguished.&nbsp; Henry then took the government of the town
into his own hands, and granted the inhabitants their first
charter.&mdash;The restless disposition of Robert however still
incited him to fresh acts of rebellion, but being taken prisoner,
he was brought over to England, and being sentenced to perpetual
imprisonment, he at length died a miserable death in Wareham
castle.</p>
<p>In 1116, the nobility of the realm did homage to William,
Henry&rsquo;s son, at Shrewsbury, and swore allegiance to his
father.</p>
<p>The conquest of Wales had always been a leading object in the
politics of England, not only from the desire of more extensive
dominion, but as a means of preventing in future the devastation
and misery which the animosity of a warlike and injured people
had occasioned on the English borders.&nbsp; The utility likewise
of employing in foreign enterprises a martial nobility, inclined
the Norman princes to encourage, by every incitement of advantage
and honour, the dangerous designs of subduing or of making
settlements <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>in Wales.&nbsp; The consequence of the attacks of the
rapacious Norman barons on the Welsh was, that Shrewsbury was
continually subject to the ravages and injuries of the contending
parties.&nbsp; Besides this, its natural strength and situation
on the borders, or as they were then termed the Marches of Wales,
rendered it extremely eligible for the rendezvous of the army
employed in the Principality, and it was therefore frequently
honoured with the presence of those who swayed the sceptre of
Britain.</p>
<p>During the struggles between Stephen and the empress Maud,
William Fitz Alan, governor of the castle of Shrewsbury, espoused
the cause of the latter, and being joined by several noblemen and
gentlemen in these parts, left his castle in the care of a
deputy, from whom he exacted an oath that he would not deliver up
his charge to the king.&nbsp; Stephen having taken the castle,
and hanged several of the garrison for the obstinacy of their
defence, Alan was forced to fly, leaving his castle and estates
in the possession of the king; but on the accession of Henry II.
he was restored to all his honours and estates, for his faithful
adherence to the fortunes of the family.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the reign of king John, a royal council
was assembled in Shrewsbury for the purpose of devising means to
put a stop to the continual and harrassing incursions of the
Welsh.&nbsp; Gwenwynwyn, prince of Powis, offered terms of
reconciliation, but, without any apparent cause, he was detained
a prisoner.&mdash;The Welsh shortly after attempted to recover
their liberties; on this occasion John assembled a large army at
Oswestry, and released Gwenwynwyn and several other Welsh
chieftains, who immediately repaired to his standard with all the
forces they could muster.&nbsp; Llewellin ap Jorwerth, who then
governed Wales, was obliged to <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>retire before this powerful army of
the British monarch, and delivered hostages to answer for the
rectitude of his conduct.&nbsp; But Llewellin, fired with the
idea of rescuing his countrymen from the yoke of foreign
government, once more broke the truce which had been
concluded.</p>
<p>When intelligence of this event reached John, his heart was so
steeled against the feelings of humanity that he ordered the
immediate execution of the hostages, 28 in number, and chiefly
children allied to the first families in Wales&mdash;a deed which
renders his name worthy to be recorded on the same page, in the
annals of cruelty, with that of Nero.&nbsp; Nottingham was the
place in which this tragical drama was acted, and from thence
John marched with his army for the purpose of chastising the
Welsh; but fear and distrust took possession of his mind, and
learning that the Pope had dissolved the allegiance of his
subjects, he dismissed his army on a sudden and returned to
London.&nbsp; Llewellin soon after suddenly appeared before
Shrewsbury, which he now entered without opposition; nor did a
long period elapse before the Welsh took ample vengeance for the
cruelties committed on their countrymen.&nbsp; An insurrection
having broke out in England, in consequence of the unpopular
ministry of Peter de Roche bishop of Winchester, in the 17th of
Henry III. many of the barons joined Llewellin, and having united
their forces, laid waste the Marches, and entering Shrewsbury,
after having plundered and burnt the town, in which were
considerable riches, they put many of the inhabitants to the
sword.&nbsp; Notwithstanding peace was established between the
contending monarchs, the national jealousies and deep rooted
hatred of the two nations were the fruitful source of perpetual
conflicts, to repress which, Henry marched with his array <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>to Shrewsbury,
where, in 1269, peace was again restored, through the mediation
of the Pope&rsquo;s legate; and the town and castle of Shrewsbury
were placed under the care of Edward, the king&rsquo;s eldest
son, afterwards the celebrated Edward I.</p>
<p>On the death of his father, Edward succeeded to the throne,
and determined to exert every effort which his power and talents
afforded, to obtain what had long been the object of his
ambition, the entire conquest of Wales.&nbsp; Soon after Easter,
1277, Edward left London to regulate the measures of the ensuing
campaign; and that the administration of justice might not be
delayed, by the absence of the king and the length of the war, he
removed the Court of Exchequer and the Court of King&rsquo;s
Bench to Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>In the general accommodation made with the vanquished
followers of Simon de Montfort, earl of Leicester, in 1264,
Llewellin ap Gryffydd was included; but he saw that a blow was
meditating by the English king, which though suspended for a
time, would be the more severe, and fall with greater weight on
his country.&nbsp; Llewellin thought it prudent to secure the
support of the adherents of the house of Montfort, of whom many
yet remained in England by solemnizing his marriage with the
daughter of the late earl.&nbsp; He therefore demanded the young
lady from the French king, to whose court on the demise of her
father she had retired, but on her passage to Wales she was taken
by some of the English vessels and detained at the court of
Edward.&nbsp; Llewellin demanded the fulfilment of a treaty made
between Henry III. and himself and the release of his bride from
Edward, while the latter required Llewellin to appear and do
homage for his kingdom, which he refused to perform unless
hostages were delivered for <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>the safety of his person.&nbsp; This
was the ostensible cause of the war undertaken by Edward, and the
pretext for attempting an entire conquest of the
principality.&nbsp; Edward cautiously avoided putting to the test
the well known valour of a nation inflamed with a just sense of
their wrongs and proud of their ancient
independence.&mdash;Llewellin unable to face an enemy pressing on
by slow, cautious, and decisive operations, returned to the
mountains of Snowdon, and Edward not choosing to enter the
recesses of that difficult country, calmly awaited the result of
his policy.&nbsp; The prospect of a famine seconded his
prudential schemes, and Llewellin had no better alternative than
to implore the clemency of the English monarch.&nbsp; Little
generosity or pity was to be expected in the terms granted by
Edward, and accordingly Llewellin agreed to pay 5000 marks as a
fine; to do homage for his crown; to relinquish all the country
between Chester and the river Conway; and to deliver hostages for
his future submission.</p>
<p>On his return to London, Edward was attended by the Welsh
prince and a numerous retinue of chieftains, for the purpose of
swearing fealty to their conqueror.&nbsp; During their stay they
were continual subjects of derision to the populace, who treated
them as savages and laughed at their foreign garb and unusual
appearance.&nbsp; To a people proud and irascible, and who,
though vanquished, were still alive to injury and insult&mdash;to
a sense of their own valour, and to the fond idea of their native
independence, this treatment could not be pleasing.&nbsp; They
therefore, privately entered into an agreement to revolt on the
first opportunity; resolving to die in their own country as
freemen, rather than come any more as vassals into England, to be
the sport of a haughty and contemptuous nation.&nbsp; Accordingly
they flew to arms.&nbsp; <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Edward, surprised to find himself
again attacked by the Welsh prince, determined to crush
effectually the rebellious spirit of the Welsh, and advanced from
Shrewsbury with a considerable army.&nbsp; The progress of the
king was at first slow, in consequence of several advantages
gained over him by Llewellin, but the latter being at length
surprised near Builth, in Brecknockshire, he was defeated, and
together with 2000 of his soldiers, slain.&nbsp; Gratitude could
pay no tribute to his memory so expressive, as the tears which
his country shed upon the tomb of their prince, who, after many
efforts to preserve the freedom of the land which gave him birth,
fell in the conflict, and found an honorable grave in its
ruins.</p>
<p>David who had previously forgotten the feuds which disturbed
the peace of his family and country, assumed, on the death of his
brother, the sovereignty of North Wales; but after various
unsuccessful struggles, he was basely betrayed into the hands of
Edward, who confined him in Rhuddlan castle, and soon after sent
him in chains to Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>Edward now (1283) summoned a parliament to meet at Shrewsbury,
for &ldquo;consulting what course to take with David prince of
Wales,&rdquo; whence, in a few days it was removed to Acton
Burnell.&nbsp; David, whilst at the English Court had been made a
baron of the realm, and it was in consequence determined to
proceed against him as a subject of the crown.&nbsp; His judges,
deaf to the claims of humanity and justice, and influenced, no
doubt, by their desire to gratify the implacable and vindictive
spirit of their master, condemned him to die as a traitor.&nbsp;
For this act of revenge, new tortures were invented.&mdash;He was
sentenced to be drawn at a horse&rsquo;s tail through the
town&mdash;to be hanged&mdash;his heart and bowels to be
burnt&mdash;his head to be cut off, and exposed at the tower of
<a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>London,
and his body quartered and hung up in different parts of the
kingdom.&nbsp; On the death of this prince, the Welsh every where
submitted to the victorious arms of the conqueror.</p>
<p>The tragical and cruel death of David closed the only
sovereignty which remained of the ancient British empire: an
empire which through various changes of fortune, had opposed the
disciplined legions of imperial Rome; and for more than eight
hundred years, had valiantly withstood the most strenuous efforts
of their Saxon and Norman invaders.</p>
<p>The conquest of Wales by the English monarch was of great
importance to Shrewsbury, the inhabitants of which had now time
for breathing, after having been for nearly 800 years in the
scene of continual warfare.</p>
<p>Edward II. visited Shrewsbury in 1322, on his march to subdue
the barons who had justly banished the Spencers and was met by
the burgesses in armour, who escorted him into the town.&nbsp;
About this period, John, one of the sons of the famous Roger
Mortimer, earl of March, was slain in a tournament held
here.&nbsp; In 1326, Edmund Fitz Alan, earl of Arundel, who had
been a faithful adherent of the weak and unfortunate Edward, was
apprehended in the neighbourhood of this place by the partizans
of the abandoned Queen and her paramour Roger Mortimer.</p>
<p>Richard II. who appears to have been particularly attached to
the inhabitants of these marches, summoned a parliament to
assemble at Shrewsbury in 1397, and which is called by Speed the
&ldquo;great parliament,&rdquo; in consequence of the
extraordinary number of peers who assembled here.&nbsp; The king
was sumptuously entertained, and the parliament too much devoted
to his interests, passed several very <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>oppressive acts.&nbsp; One of the
articles of accusation on which he was afterwards deposed,
charges him with &ldquo;procuring the many oppressive acts passed
in the parliament of Shrewsbury, and with intimidating the judges
and other persons whom he caused to come before him
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the following reign the Welsh made another attempt to
recover their freedom under the celebrated Owen Glyndwr.&nbsp;
Twice were Henry and his generals obliged to retire from their
meditated attack of Owen without bringing him to any action, and
his rebellion assumed a more serious appearance from the support
which he received from the earls of Northumberland and Worcester,
and the earl of Douglas, who were disgusted with the treatment
which they had received from Henry.&nbsp; At the commencement of
the war, Northumberland was suddenly taken ill at
Berwick&mdash;Hotspur his son accordingly took the command of the
troops, amounting to about 12,000 chosen men, and marched towards
Shrewsbury to unite his forces with those of the Welsh
chieftain.&nbsp; The king aware of the importance of every
moment, also hurried to Shrewsbury, and interposed himself
between Hotspur and Glyndwr.&nbsp; This moment saved his crown;
and the prudence of the one leader and the impetuosity of the
other induced them to hasten a general engagement.</p>
<p>Previous to the engagement, Henry sent Thomas Presbury, abbot
of Shrewsbury, with offers of pardon to Percy&rsquo;s army if
they would disperse, but this message being misrepresented to
Percy by the earl of Worcester, the former sent a manifesto into
the royal army in which he renounced his allegiance to Henry and
enumerated at length various grievances and indignities of which
he conceived the nation in common with his own family had to
complain.&nbsp; This manifesto <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>tended to inflame the passions of
both parties; and the ability of the respective commanders, the
valour of the soldiers and their equality in point of numbers,
gave reason to expect a dreadful and doubtful contest.&nbsp; The
battle was fought at Oldfield or Bullfield, now Battlefield,
about 3 miles north of Shrewsbury, on St. Magdalene&rsquo;s eve,
July 22, 1403.&nbsp; The onset commenced near Berwick with a
terrible discharge of arrows from both lines.&nbsp; The Scots
rushed with impetuous fury upon the front of the royal army,
which began to give way, but the king arriving with
reinforcements they again rallied and recovered their
ground.&nbsp; Henry exposed his person in the thickest of the
fight and combated with an ardour worthy the crown he was
defending.&nbsp; His valiant son whose military achievements in
France were afterwards so renowned and whose wild youthful
excesses are so beautifully pourtrayed by our great dramatic
bard, here performed his noviciate in arms, signalized himself on
his father&rsquo;s footsteps, and regained his good
opinion.&nbsp; The gallant Percy supported that brilliant fame he
had acquired in so many bloody engagements, and Douglas,</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose
high deeds,<br />
Whose hot incursions, and great name in arms<br />
Holds from all soldiers chief majority,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the ancient enemy of Percy but now his friend, still appeared
his rival amidst the horror and confusion of the day.&nbsp; This
nobleman performed feats of valour which are almost
incredible.&nbsp; He seemed determined that the king of England
should that day fall by his arm: and as Henry either to elude the
attacks of the enemy on his person, or to encourage his own men
by the belief of his presence every where, had accoutred several
captains in the royal garb; the sword of Douglas rendered this
proud distinction fatal <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>to many.&nbsp; Having dispatched sir
Walter Blount, the king&rsquo;s standard bearer, he assailed
Henry with such fury that it was with difficulty he escaped to
another part of the field.&nbsp; But while the armies were
contending in this furious manner, the death of Percy by an
unknown hand, decided the fate of the day and the royalists
prevailed.&nbsp; On this memorable day, which is immortalized by
the genius of Shakspeare, it is supposed that 7000 men were
slain.&nbsp; A great number of persons of distinction were killed
on both aides, and the earls of Douglas and Worcester, taken
prisoners; the latter was after beheaded at Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>This battle, which fixed the house of Lancaster on the throne
during three reigns, is among those of the first importance
recorded in ancient English history, and may be named as the
first of those conflicts between the white and red roses, which
some years after deluged the nation with some of its best blood,
and filled it with intestine ravages and divisions.</p>
<p>Owen Glyndwr had the mortification to be obliged to remain
inactive at the head of his troops at Oswestry, from whence he
retired on hearing of Percy&rsquo;s defeat: and although he
afterwards attempted, he was unable to regain the independence of
his native country.&mdash;He died in Herefordshire in 1414.&nbsp;
Henry returned thanks to heaven for this brilliant victory, and
founded the collegiate church at Battlefield on the spot where it
is probable most of the slain were buried.</p>
<p>During the fatal quarrel between the houses of York and
Lancaster, which is computed to have cost the lives of eighty
princes of the blood, and to have almost entirely annihilated the
ancient nobility of England, Shrewsbury remained steadily
attached to the Yorkists, and previous to the battle of St.
Albans, <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>Richard Plantagenet, duke of York wrote to his
&ldquo;right worshipful friends the bailiffs, burgesses and
commoners of the good town of Shrewsbury,&rdquo; requesting
assistance in his enterprise for the recovery of his
throne.&nbsp; After his defeat and death at Wakefield, his son
Edward, earl of March, appeared in Shrewsbury, entreating a
supply of men to revenge his father&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; With an
army of 23,000 men chiefly raised in this neighbourhood, he
obtained a decisive victory at Mortimer&rsquo;s Cross in
Herefordshire, from whence advancing rapidly to London he was
shortly afterwards proclaimed king.&nbsp; Edward, duly sensible
of the strength and inviolable attachment of Shrewsbury to his
cause, committed the care of his queen to its inhabitants, and
during her residence here she twice lay in at the convent of the
Black Friars, and was delivered of Richard and George
Plantagenet, the former of whom was murdered in the Tower through
the cruelty of his uncle Richard III. and the latter died
young.</p>
<p>In 1484, Henry Stafford, duke of Buckingham, having entered
into a conspiracy for the purpose of depriving Richard of a
throne which he had acquired by such manifold injustice, and his
endeavours being frustrated, fled to the house of one Bannister,
at Shinewood, near Wenlock, in order to concealment, but
notwithstanding Bannister was indebted to the duke for the
property he enjoyed, unable to withstand the temptation of so
large a reward as &pound;1000, basely betrayed him to John
Mitton, esq. then sheriff of the county, who conducted him to
Shrewsbury, where Richard shortly after arrived, and feasted his
eyes with the execution of his enemy.</p>
<p>The crimes of Richard were so horrid and so shocking to
humanity that the natural sentiments of men, without any
political or public views, were sufficient <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>to render his
government unstable; and every person of probity and honour,
earnest to prevent the sceptre from being any longer polluted by
the bloody and faithless hand which held it, at length united in
favour of the earl of Richmond.&nbsp; This nobleman set sail from
Harfleur, in France, on the 7th of August, 1484, and landed at
Milford Haven, in Pembrokeshire, without opposition, with about
2000 followers.&nbsp; He directed his course to that part of the
kingdom in hopes that the Welsh, who regarded him as their
countryman, and who had been already prepossessed in favour of
his cause by means of the late duke of Buckingham, would join his
standard.&nbsp; Richard, not knowing where to expect his
antagonist, took post at Nottingham, and purposed to fly on the
first alarm to the place exposed to danger.&nbsp; He had
appointed sir Rice ap Thomas and sir Walter Herbert to defend the
coasts of Wales; but the former joined Richmond, and the latter
made scarcely any resistance.&nbsp; The earl advanced towards
Shrewsbury, which was the only convenient place at which he could
cross the Severn, but very unexpectedly found the gates shut
against him; and on his demanding entrance by his herald, he was
refused, &ldquo;the head bailey, Maister Myttoon, being a stoute
wyse gentilman,&rdquo; saying, &ldquo;that he knew no kynge, but
only kynge Richard, whose lyffetenants he and hys fellows were;
and before he should entir there, he should go over hys belly,
meaninge thereby, that he would be slayne to the ground, and that
he protested vehementlye on the othe he had tacken; but on better
advice, Maister Myttoon permitted the kynge to pass; but to save
his othe, the sayd Myttoon lay alonge the grounde, and his belly
upwardes, and soe the sayd erle stepped over hym and saved hys
othe.&rdquo;&nbsp; Previous to his reaching Shrewsbury his army
scarcely <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>deserved that name, from their wretched appearance and
small numbers; but being joined by sir Gilbert Talbot with 2000
of the tenants of his nephew, the earl of Shrewsbury, together
with several gentlemen of rank, his cause began to wear a
favourable aspect, and marching on with his army, now amounting
to about 6000 men Richmond gained the brilliant and decisive
victory of Bosworth; Richard perishing by a fate too mild and
honourable for his multiplied and detestable enormities.</p>
<p>It is supposed by some that that plague, the sweating
sickness, which broke out here in 1485, originated among
Henry&rsquo;s foreign levies; it afterwards infested the kingdom
at different periods for 60 years: and, according to Mr. Pennant,
Shrewsbury particularly felt its ravages, 1000 nearly dying per
day at one period.</p>
<p>Henry was not unmindful of the reception he met with here,
and, when quietly seated on the throne, several times visited the
town, particularly in 1495, when he was sumptuously entertained
in the castle by the corporation.</p>
<p>Nothing worthy of note in the history occurs from this period
until the struggle between the Parliament and Charles I.; the
former for their privileges and the rights of the people, and the
latter for arbitrary power as a despotic monarch.&nbsp; Charles,
determined to try the force of arms, erected the royal standard
at Nottingham, the open signal of discord and civil war
throughout the kingdom.&nbsp; Whilst many of the large towns and
corporate bodies took part with the parliament, a great
proportion of the nobility and gentry sided with the king; the
latter was the case with the Salopians.&nbsp; Not meeting with
the support which he expected in the vicinity of Nottingham,
Charles after a little hesitation pursued his march to <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Shrewsbury
&ldquo;in regard of the strong and pleasant situation of it, one
side being defended by the Severn, the other having secure
passage into Wales;&rdquo; having received information that the
place was entirely devoted to him.</p>
<p>At Wellington the king passed one night, and on the following
morning made a rendezvous of all his forces on the plain beneath
the Wrekin.&nbsp; His orders having been read at the head of each
regiment, he placed himself in the midst of his army, and that he
might bind himself by reciprocal ties, he solemnly made the
following declaration in their presence; &ldquo;I do promise, in
the presence of Almighty God, and as I hope for his blessing and
protection, that I will, to the utmost of my power, defend and
maintain the true reformed protestant religion, established in
the church of England, and by the grace of God, in the same will
live and die.&nbsp; I desire that the laws may ever be the
measure of my government, and that the liberty and property of
the subject may be preserved by them with the same care as my own
just rights.&nbsp; And if it please God by his blessing on this
army raised for my necessary defence to preserve me from the
present rebellion, I do solemnly and faithfully promise in the
sight of God, to maintain the just privileges and freedom of
parliament, and to govern to the utmost of my power, by the known
statutes and customs of the kingdom, and particularly to observe
inviolably the laws to which I have given my consent this
parliament.&nbsp; Mean while, if this emergency and the great
necessity to which I am driven, beget any violation of law, I
hope it shall be imputed by God and man to the authors of this
war; not to me, who have so earnestly laboured to preserve the
peace of the kingdom.&nbsp; When I willingly fail in <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>these
particulars, I shall expect no aid or relief from man, nor any
protection from above; but in this resolution I hope for the
cheerful assistance of all good men, and am confident of the
blessing of Heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; Had Charles previously acted up
to this declaration, he would not now have been placed in such a
critical situation.</p>
<p>Although the tyrannical proceedings of the king had induced
many of the Salopians to look upon his cause in an unfavourable
light, yet his mild and amiable behaviour won on the inhabitants
generally, so much so that a considerable number enrolled
themselves as volunteers in his service.&nbsp; In order to give
efficiency to his troops and maintain his cause, a mint was
established here for the purpose of coining the plate which had
been presented to him by various public bodies and private
individuals; but at such a low ebb were the mechanic arts at this
period, that scarcely &pound;1000 per week could be coined.</p>
<p>However despicable the royal army appeared when it marched
from Nottingham, its improvement was rapid on its arrival in
Shrewsbury, so that in about twenty days it mustered 12000 men,
chiefly persons of considerable property, from the neighbouring
parts.&nbsp; But they were exceedingly ill equipped, for says
Clarendon; &ldquo;In the whole body not a pikeman had a corselet,
and very few musketeers had swords.&rdquo;&mdash;Add to this,
that there was not a single tent, and very few waggons attached
to the whole train.&nbsp; With this ill accoutred but high
spirited body, Charles took his leave of Shrewsbury, on the 12th
of October, 1642.</p>
<p>On the departure of the king, a garrison was left in town, of
which Lord Capel was appointed governor, and a fort was erected
on an eminence above Frankwell, to secure that quarter from
attack.&nbsp; Capel <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>was severally succeeded by Sir Fulke Hunkes (a relative
of the celebrated Baxter, the non-conformist,) Sir Richard
Otteley, and Sir Michael Earnley.&nbsp; This gentleman was in a
very declining state of health, in consequence of which many
disorders crept in among the garrison, and gave the commanders of
the parliamentary forces in the neighbourhood, opportunity to
attempt the conquest of so important a post.&nbsp; After two
unsuccessful attempts by Colonels Mitton, and Langhorne, two
enterprising officers, they at length attained the object of
their wishes.&nbsp; Having arrived before the town with fifteen
hundred picked men of the garrisons of Wem and Oswestry, they
contrived to convey eight carpenters up the river, who were
landed within a breast work on the east side of the castle hill,
and notwithstanding they were fired on by the centinels, they
continued to cut down a sufficient quantity of palisadoes to
enable the troops to enter.&nbsp; After storming a rampart
beneath the Council House, a large body of troops entered by St.
Mary&rsquo;s Water-Lane, where the guard, having been intoxicated
or bribed, made no resistance.&nbsp; Having opened the north
gate, the horse immediately marched in, commanded by Cols. Mitton
and Bowyer.&mdash;The consternation of the inhabitants may be
easily imagined.&nbsp; The preceding night they had retired to
rest, confident in their supposed security, but by daylight in
the morning they were in the hands of their enemies; and,
notwithstanding the humane exertions of Col. Mitton, the soldiery
were not to be restrained from plundering the peaceably disposed
of their private property.&nbsp; The first intimation which the
governor received of the surprise of the town, was the entrance
of some of his enemies into his chamber, where he fell covered
with wounds, repeatedly refusing quarter, being determined not to
outlive the disgrace <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>of the day.&nbsp; The English part of
the garrison were suffered to march to Ludlow, but the Irish were
left to the discretion of Col. Mitton.&nbsp; The fort at
Frankwell bravely held out till night, but finding resistance
useless, at length surrendered at discretion.&nbsp; A number of
prisoners of rank were taken, besides 15 pieces of cannon, a
large stand of arms, and the whole of prince Maurice&rsquo;s
magazine.&nbsp; Nor did the plate and valuable effects of many of
the surrounding gentry, placed in the castle for security, during
the turbulence of the times, meet a better fate: the whole of it
to a vast amount, falling into the hands of the victors.&nbsp;
For this important achievement, Colonel Mitton received the
thanks of Parliament.&nbsp; The fall of Shrewsbury was a death
blow to Charles&rsquo;s expectations in this quarter; for besides
its being the key to North Wales, it caused the dissolution of a
formidable confederacy between the counties of Salop, Worcester,
Chester and Flint, then on the eve of assembling to defend the
falling fortunes of their king.</p>
<p>After the battle of Worcester, so fatal to the royal cause, a
commission was sent to Chester by the Parliament, to try the Earl
of Derby, and other gentlemen on charges of treason and
rebellion; or in other words, for having borne arms in defence of
Charles.&nbsp; One of these was Colonel John Benbow, who, in the
beginning of the contest, had united with the parliamentary army,
and distinguished himself at the surprise of Shrewsbury.&nbsp;
Afterwards, disgusted with the violent proceedings against the
king, and perceiving that the object of the leaders of his party
was private aggrandizement, and not the welfare of their country,
he left them and repaired to the royal standard.&nbsp; This was a
crime which could not be pardoned; he was therefore condemned to
death.&nbsp; That his punishment <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>might be rendered most bitter, the
sentence was pronounced by Colonel Mackworth, once his friend and
fellow soldier; and it was ordered to be executed at his native
town of Shrewsbury, that a terrible impression might be made on
the inhabitants of that loyal place.&nbsp; He was shot on the
green before the castle, October 15, 1651, and suffered with
great intrepidity.&nbsp; This respectable officer was uncle to
the celebrated admiral Benbow.</p>
<p>An unsuccessful attempt was made to surprise the castle, in
order to favour the restoration of Charles the second, in 1654,
but it ended merely in plunging the king&rsquo;s friends still
deeper in misery and ruin: among the most active in this
enterprise was Sir Thomas Harris, who suffered most severely for
his well intended zeal.&nbsp; After Cromwell&rsquo;s death, and
the restoration of the long parliament, upon Sir George
Booth&rsquo;s rising in Cheshire for the king, the venerable Sir
Thomas Middleton, then 80 years of age, proclaimed him at
Wrexham, which so much encouraged the royalists of Shropshire and
Denbighshire, that they immediately sent a party to seize
Shrewsbury, but though the friends of monarchy were very numerous
in it, Captain Edmund Waringe of Oldbury, the governor, prevented
their design, and secured the place for the parliament.&nbsp; In
1683, when the nation was thrown into a ferment, by the discovery
of the Rye House Plot, this town was one of those which the
conspirators, presuming on its general disaffection to the
government of Charles the second, proposed to have seized.&nbsp;
Such at least was the deposition of the infamous Colonel Romsey,
a wretch on whose head lies the blood of the virtuous and
patriotic Russel&mdash;who adds, in his narrative, that there
were in the castle 38 barrels of powder, 138 pounds in the
barrel, with arms for 300 men and great guns.&nbsp; <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>&ldquo;The
castle,&rdquo; he, observes, &ldquo;is strong by situation, and
lies so conveniently, that either from the north or west, or
Midland, or Wales, the rebellious party might easily resort
thither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last royal visit paid to this town was by the bigotted
James the second, who passed the 25th of August, 1687, here, and
kept his court at the Council House.&nbsp; The sentiments of
loyal attachment, for which Shrewsbury has ever been conspicuous,
burst forth on this occasion, with chivalrous
enthusiasm.&mdash;They blazed in bonfires and illuminations, and
literally ran through the streets in torrents of wine, the public
conduits being charged with this royal liquid.</p>
<p>Having brought down the general history of Shrewsbury to a
late date, we shall now proceed to view its local
character.&nbsp; There is no doubt that its Trade was formerly
very considerable, and though its importance in this respect may
have been eclipsed by the more eligible situation of numerous
other places for the manufacture of various articles, it has
never ceased to enjoy a considerable share of internal
commerce.&nbsp; Heylyn speaks of it as &ldquo;a fair and goodly
town, well traded and frequented by all sorts of people, both
Welsh and English, by reason of the <i>trade of cloth</i>, and
other Merchandise; it being the common mart or emptory between
Wales and England,&rdquo; and Mr. Pennant, who wrote his account
of Shrewsbury above 40 years ago, gives the following account of
its trade in Welsh woollens: &ldquo;From very early days this
place possessed almost exclusively the trade with Wales in a
coarse kind of woollen cloth called Welsh webs, which were
brought from Merioneth and Montgomeryshires to a market held here
weekly on Thursday.&nbsp; They were afterwards dressed, that is,
the wool raised on one side, by a set of people called
Shearmen.&nbsp; At the time of <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>Queen Elizabeth, the trade was so
great, that not fewer than 600 persons maintained themselves by
this occupation.&nbsp; The cloth was sent chiefly to America to
clothe the negroes, or to Flanders; where it is used by the
peasants.&nbsp; At present the greatest part of this traffic is
diverted into other channels, and not more than 4 or 5000 yards
are brought to the ancient mart.&rdquo;&nbsp; This market is now
entirely done away, through an unfortunate disagreement between
the manufacturers of these articles and the drapers of
Shrewsbury, and the market is now held at Welsh Pool every other
Thursday.&nbsp; The mode of raising the wool on one side,
described by Mr. Pennant, being found to be injurious to the
texture of the cloth, the number of shearman has considerable
declined, insomuch that there are only a few in the town at this
time.&nbsp; Beside, its trade in Welsh flannels and webs, a
brewery appears to have been established here in 1618; and in the
reign of Henry VIII. and Elizabeth it was famous for its glove
and shoe manufactory.</p>
<p>Nor is the trade carried on in Shrewsbury at this period
inconsiderable&mdash;being the capital of a large and populous
county, its vicinity to the principality of Wales, and the
facility with which articles of every description are forwarded
either by land or water carriage, render it an extensive mart for
the disposal of goods.&nbsp; Here are two very large linen
factories, besides manufactories for starch, soap, flannels,
cotton goods, an extensive iron and brass foundry, two ale and
porter breweries, a spirit distillery, &amp;c. which will be
noticed under their proper heads, as well as various mechanical
trades which are common to all other large towns, and which
contribute in no small degree to the accumulation of wealth, to
the enjoyment of the conveniences of life, and to the power of
benevolent actions by the inhabitants.</p>
<p><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>Shrewsbury is also famed for its excellent brawn and a
kind of sweet flat cake, whose good qualities are celebrated by
the elegant pen of Shenstone,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For here each season do those cakes
abide,<br />
Whose honoured names the inventive city own,<br />
Rend&rsquo;ring thro&rsquo; Britain&rsquo;s isle, Salopia&rsquo;s
praises known.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the increase of trade and riches we must also connect
that of its population and its consequent extension of
buildings.&nbsp; In the reign of Edward the Confessor there were
only 252 houses here, and the earliest calculation of the number
of inhabitants on record is in 1695; the town then contained 7383
persons&mdash;in 1750, there were 8141 inhabitants and 1884
houses.&nbsp; In the years 1801, 1811, and 1821, enumerations
were made, agreeable to orders of the House of Commons, and which
are here subjoined:</p>

</table>
<p>From these statements it appears that an increase of 2063
persons took place in the first 10 years, and 2700 in the second,
but it should be observed that as each parish extends more or
less into the surrounding country, it is probable that the town
does not contain more than 16,000 inhabitants.</p>
<p>Although much remains to be done in order to put Shrewsbury on
an equality, with respect to elegance and convenience, with many
other places not its superiors in size, wealth, or situation,
numerous praise-worthy improvements have taken place during the
last 60 years.&nbsp; Previous to that period there was but one
Inn (the Raven) of any extent for the accommodation of strangers,
no stage coach; neither cart nor waggon was employed for the
conveyance of goods, <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>packhorses being only in use; and
such persons as had occasion to travel were obliged to perform
their journies on horseback, postchaises being unknown.&mdash;At
length about 1761 the first stage coach made its appearance in
Shrewsbury, and since that period by the indefatigable
perseverance of the late Mr. Robert Lawrence, of the Lion Inn, in
completing the communications and bettering the roads: a noble
and substantial Guildhall, two beautiful stone bridges over the
river Severn, together with two new and elegant churches, and a
great number of charitable and benevolent erections have given
additional beauty to this interesting and venerable town.&nbsp;
Its suburbs have been materially enlarged and improved, many
obstructions in the principal streets removed, and the facilities
for travelling have been astonishingly increased.</p>
<p>The government and police of Shrewsbury have the next claim on
our attention.&nbsp; It is a corporation by prescription, and
charters have been granted to it by almost every king of England
since William the Norman.&nbsp; The first regular charter was
granted by Henry I.; this was confirmed by John, who in addition
empowered the burgesses to chuse two pr&oelig;positi of bailiffs
removeable only on bad behaviour; but it was not until Edward
III. that the bailiffs were constituted magistrates and
authorised to hold a session for the trial of causes.&nbsp; The
institution of aldermen is supposed have taken place in the 12th
of Richard II. for &ldquo;about the year 1390, the earl of
Arundel being commissioned by the king to end certain disputes
among the Burgesses, awarded that for the good government of the
town for the future, the commonalty should elect out of
themselves twelve of the most sufficient persons who should <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>continue in
their office for two years from the feast of St.
Giles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the charter of Charles I. granted in 1638, the corporation
was new modelled changing the offices of bailiffs into that of a
mayor, recorder, steward, town clerk, 24 aldermen, 48 assistants
or common councilmen, two chamberlains, a sword bearer, serjeants
at mace, &amp;c. &amp;c.; and that the mayor, bishop of Lichfield
and Coventry, recorder, steward, 3 senior aldermen, and the
alderman who last served the office of mayor, should act as
Justices within the town and liberties of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; In
this form it now exists.&nbsp; The right of electing the
corporate officers is vested in the common council by whom the
mayor is chosen annually on the Friday after St.
Bartholomew.&nbsp; The general session is held quarterly by the
justices of the peace for the borough; and the mayor or some of
the aldermen and justices attend the Exchequer every Tuesday to
transact public business.&nbsp; A court of requests, for the
recovery of debts under the value of forty shillings, is held in
the town hall every other Wednesday.&nbsp; The number of its
commissioners is about 30, the eligibility for election to which
office consists in residence in the town and the possession of
freehold property of the value of &pound;30 per annum, or a
personal estate of &pound;600 value clear of all deductions.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the corporation is empowered to enact laws for
the most effectual administration of the police of the town, this
branch of internal government is in a very disorganized state;
yet the many useful regulations which have been established, and
the strict and impartial manner in which they are enforced,
reflect the greatest credit on the magistrates and conduce to the
peaceable demeanour of <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>the inhabitants and the order and
respectability of the town.&nbsp; But the most impartial observer
will see that much remains to be done for the prevention of
immorality; and though it is impossible that the most
enlightened, active and persevering magistracy, aided by the
continued exertions of the inhabitants can prevent individual
delinquency, something may yet be achieved for the preservation
of public morals, some plan devised which may foster the sparks
of pure and proper feeling as an antidote to that national
dereliction of manners in which Shrewsbury in common with most
other large towns participates too much.</p>
<p>In addition to the Corporation here are sixteen chartered
companies, consisting of various trades, to exercise any of
which, within the liberties, no person is admitted who has not
either served a legal apprenticeship or paid a sum of money,
entitled, &ldquo;a foreigner&rsquo;s fine&rdquo;, which is of
various amount in the several fraternities.&mdash;An ancient
ceremony, called the Show, used by these, deserves to be
recorded, as perhaps, (with the exception of Coventry) it is the
only one of the kind now existing in the kingdom.&nbsp; On the
second Monday after Trinity Sunday the various companies assemble
in front of the castle, with their wardens, flags, devices,
&amp;c. &amp;c., each having at their head some person gaudily
dressed; some in representation perhaps of the monarchs who
granted their respective charters, whilst others display devices
and insignia emblematical of the trades which they
practise.&nbsp; The procession being arranged, moves over the
Welsh bridge to a piece of ground, on the west side the river,
and adjoining the town, called Kingsland, where each company has
its arbour, in which is a cold dinner <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>provided for the entertainment of the
mayor and corporation, who visit the various arbours with their
attendants, decorated in all &ldquo;the pomp and
circumstance&rdquo; of office.&nbsp; After spending the evening
in festivity and mirth, the several companies retire from
Kingsland, much invigorated with the essence of barley corn, and
return into town over the English bridge.</p>
<p>This ancient pageant is now fast approaching its
dissolution.&nbsp; During the few last years, the master
tradesmen have entirely ceased to walk in procession to the
ancient spot, and the ceremony is now continued only by the
apprentices of the chartered companies most numerous in the
town.&nbsp; The custom originated in the celebration of the feast
of Corpus Christi, one of the most splendid feasts of the Romish
Church.&nbsp; After the reformation, the religious part of the
ceremony was discontinued, but one day was still set apart for
the express purpose of idleness, jollity and merriment.</p>
<p>The first return of Members of Parliament to represent the
town of Shrewsbury appears to have been in the 26th of Edward the
first.&nbsp; The right of election is vested in the resident
burgesses, paying scot and lot, and not receiving alms: the mayor
being the returning officer.&nbsp; The burgesses who polled at
the contested election, in 1819, were 688 in number.&mdash;The
freedom of Shrewsbury (with respect to voting) is acquired by
serving seven years apprenticeship to a burgess residing within
the liberties, or by birth within the liberties on paying the sum
of &pound;7 4s. 0d.; every male child of a burgess, who may be
born after his father has been sworn in, can claim his burgesship
on the payment of &pound;1 6s., whether born in the town or
not.&nbsp; Honorary freedoms may be also given <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>by the body
corporate.&nbsp; The members who represent the town of Shrewsbury
in the British Parliament, are two in number.</p>
<p>Considered as a place of residence, Shrewsbury has the
advantage of a salubrious air and mild temperature.&nbsp; At a
short distance from the town in a N.E. aspect, a very accurate
observer found the mercury in the thermometer down at 8&deg; in
January 1814.&mdash;By observations on the variations of the
thermometer for one year, the same gentleman found that the mean
temperature of the same year was 46&deg;, and that the
variations, during the course of the year amounted to 77&deg;,
varying from 8&deg; to 83&deg;.&nbsp; In South Carolina, the
annual variation has extended to 83&deg;.&nbsp; The winter of
this year, it may be recollected, was much colder and the summer
hotter than is common at Shrewsbury, and yet the highest degree
to which the mercury rose was 85&deg;.&nbsp; In the East Indies,
the mercury is frequently at 104&deg;.&nbsp; From accurate
observation it appeared, that the medium of the daily variations
was nearly regular in its increase till June, and from the close
of that month till the end of December was again almost uniformly
diminishing.&nbsp; The medium of the daily variations was no more
than 6&deg;, whereas in some places they reach 30&deg;.&nbsp;
From these statements it appears that we are free from those
sudden changes of the atmosphere which generally very much
affect, and often prove fatal to, the human frame.</p>
<p>That this is a fact may be inferred from the similar
temperature of Shrewsbury with that of Sidmouth, in Devonshire,
one of the most healthy places perhaps in this kingdom: In the
year 1814, the mean temperature was 47&deg;, only one degree
above that of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; This observation is also
supported by the tables published by Dr. Price, on Reversionary
Payments, <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>in which he proves, from the Bills of Mortality that out
of 1000 persons born, there were alive</p>

<p>The relative degrees of vitality are thus shewn in a more
perspicuous manner than by any other method and from the above
table it is evident that the temperature of Shrewsbury is in most
instances nearly equal, and in some superior, to the warm
climates of France and Switzerland, and extremely favourable to
longevity.</p>
<p>The elevation of the town, together with the purity of its
atmosphere and the excellence of its water, renders its situation
extremely salubrious.&nbsp; Contagious diseases are very
rare.&nbsp; The scarlet fever, measles, hooping cough, &amp;c.
are usually very mild.&nbsp; The residents in the immediate
vicinity of the Severn are most liable to illness, and in these
cases the inflammatory symptoms generally run high.&nbsp; Many
parts of the town and its environs may justly be recommended as
eligible residences for invalids, who visit Shrewsbury from
Ireland, Wales, and various parts of the United Kingdom, to avail
themselves of the able medical assistance which the town
affords.</p>
<p>Shrewsbury is built on two hills, of easy ascent, which for
the most part gently slope to the river Severn; by this stream
the ground on which the town stands is formed into a peninsula,
the castle being judiciously placed on the isthmus, and thus
commanding the entrances to the town.</p>
<p>Like most ether places not of Roman origin, its streets are
extremely irregular; nor had its buildings, until within these
few years, any claim to superiority, <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>the ancient houses being chiefly
built with projections into the public streets&mdash;an
inconvenience very properly remedied by the elegance of modern
erections.&nbsp; Its suburbs have of late years very much
increased, and, in conjunction with this, many excellent
improvements have been made in removing obstructions from the
entrances to the town: but, notwithstanding the natural
advantages it possesses, the bad state of its pavement and the
filthy picture continually presented by its streets, is a source
of poignant regret.</p>
<p>The plain of Shropshire, in which the town is situated, is of
considerable extent, divided by the Severn into two unequal
portions, and though flat, when compared with the surrounding
hills, of a very varied surface.&nbsp; Its greatest length from
N. to S. is about 30 miles, comprehending the space between
Whitchurch and Church Stretton; its breadth from Oswestry to
Coalbrookdale, is about 28 miles.&nbsp; Shrewsbury, when viewed
from any of its adjacent eminences, presents a beautiful and
interesting scene, and the eye of the spectator is led to survey
the most extensive amphitheatre of mountains which perhaps the
island can boast.&nbsp; The Wrekin is connected by the gentle
hills of Acton Burnel and Frodesley, (over which the gigantic
summit of Brown Clee is conspicuous,) with the Lawley and
Coredock, generally called the Stretton Hills, from whence the
Longmynd, Stiperstones, and Long Mountain, from an uninterrupted
chain, with the bold and precipitous cliffs of the Kefn y Castyr,
Moel y Golfa, and Breyddin, surmounted by an obelisk in honour of
the late gallant Lord Rodney; thence the horizon is bounded by
the stupendous Berwin range, losing their blue summits in the
clouds; while the northern view is terminated by the humbler but
beautiful eminences of Grinshill, Pymhill, Hawkstone, Haughmond,
&amp;c., round to the Wrekin.&nbsp; The <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>whole of this
vast circle incloses a finely wooded and beautifully diversified
champaign country, of gentle hill and dale, studded with numerous
gentlemen&rsquo;s seats&mdash;watered with various
streams&mdash;eminently fertile in arable, meadow, and pasture;
and amply justifying the eulogium of an ancient British poet,
who, after gazing, as he tells us, on the plain of Shropshire,
from the height of Charlton Hill, calls it the paradise of
<i>Cymru</i>. <a name="citation33"></a><a href="#footnote33"
class="citation">[33]</a>&nbsp; The glittering rays of the Sun
gilding the lofty spires of the town&mdash;the bold and ancient
appearance of its ivy-mantled castle&mdash;the lovely pleasure
and garden grounds which nearly surround it and gently slope from
the mouldering ruins of its once warlike walls to the majestic
Severn, which, fringed with lofty tufts of trees of various
foliages, &ldquo;proudly rolls its crystal stream along;&rdquo;
altogether form one of the most picturesque and enchanting
prospects any where to be met with.&nbsp; Added to this, the well
known salubrity of its air, and the many agreeable promenades
which on every side of the town present themselves; and the
compiler thinks he will not be esteemed too vain in asserting,
that his native town is not surpassed, (though, for aught he
knows, it may be equalled,) in point of situation, wholesomeness,
and picturesque scenery, by any place of equal size in Great
Britain.</p>
<p>The general character and manners of the inhabitants of
Shrewsbury, as they assume no characteristic sufficient to
distinguish them from those of other towns similarly
circumstanced and situated, will not long detain the attention of
the visitor.&nbsp; He will not often be disgusted with the petty
assumptions of office clothed with a &ldquo;little brief
authority,&rdquo; nor will he be displeased in perceiving, in a
large majority of the <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>inhabitants, a considerable portion
of civility, hospitality, social intercourse, and liberality of
opinion; and if great refinement of manners do not characterise
them in the aggregate, the stranger will have employed his
leisure to little advantage, who does not soon discover in the
town a very extensive share of that frankness, benevolence, and
warmth which is a prominent feature in the old-British
character.&nbsp; Numbers in the different ranks of society are to
be met with whose lives are adorned with the honours due to
industry, integrity and virtue; and if we add the munificence
with which the various public charities are supported by
Salopians in general&mdash;who</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash; Learn the luxury of doing good,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in the diffusion of a part of these superfluities with which a
benignant Providence has crowned their labours, the writer thinks
he is not saying too much when he observes that benevolence is
strongly marked in the general portrait.&nbsp; The different
churches and chapels are, on the whole, well attended; and in few
towns of equal size is there a more decent and orderly observance
of the Sabbath.&nbsp; It is, however, to be regretted that many
of its residents are destitute of that urbanity and politeness
which should ever be displayed to strangers; but it is probable
this circumstances to be attributed chiefly to the pride of
nobility and ancestry, which looks down with half averted eyes on
supposed inferiority; and to the want of an enlarged commixture
with mankind, producing a generosity of disposition, and
moderation of principle which are the natural results of
extensive commercial pursuits.</p>
<p>Difference of opinion on the actions of public men,&mdash;on
the measures pursued by persons holding the first political
situations in the state, and on religious <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>subjects; are
compatible with the purest loyalty and most fervent patriotism,
and will be readily acknowledged by those who possess any share
of liberality add reflection.</p>
<p>To the infinite credit of Shrewsbury, its population has not
been led to the perpetration of any of those acts of violence and
atrocity which have disgraced other places, and which are caused
by the difference of religious opinion, of the political
effervescence of the times in which such outrages may have taken
place.&nbsp; This observation, however, is not intended to impute
to the inhabitants any thing like a state of passive obedience or
wilful ignorance&mdash;far otherwise.&nbsp; This judicious
conduct by which the welfare and good order of the town have been
so essentially promoted, is perhaps rather attributable to the
candour and prudence of the leaders of the various political
parties, or to the virtue of mutual forbearance happily exercised
by the inhabitants at large.</p>
<p>On subjects, however connected with the safety and prosperity
of the British Empire, and the welfare of the illustrious house
of Brunswick, Shrewsbury has ever been among the foremost in
displaying its patriotic spirit and affectionate
attachment.&nbsp; The loyalty of the inhabitants has long been
pre-eminent, so much so, that it is celebrated by the elegant pen
of Shenstone.</p>
<blockquote><p>Admir&rsquo;d Salopia, that with venial pride<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Eyes her bright form in Severn&rsquo;s ambient
wave;<br />
Fam&rsquo;d for her cares in loyal perils try&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Her Daughters lovely and her
Striplings brave</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As early as the year 1715, this town displayed its consequence
and attachment to the present royal family in a very spirited
manner.&nbsp; A considerable body of horse and foot was raised by
Lord Newport, Sir C. Lloyd, Bart., W. Kynaston, T. Gardner, and
J. <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>Fownes,
Esquires, for the protection of Shrewsbury; the walls were put in
a state of defence, new gates, &amp;c. made, and brigadier
Dormer&rsquo;s regiment, then lying in this town, received orders
to march to Preston, Shrewsbury being deemed secure from the
strength of its <i>own</i> garrison.&nbsp; In 1745, also, the
earl of Powis raised a regiment here, for the service of the
state, into which many gentlemen of the town and neighbourhood
entered as volunteers.&nbsp; During the war with the French
republic two regiments were raised in Shrewsbury, one by colonel
Cuyler, (the present 86th) and the other by colonel, now general
Williams, and the inhabitants contributed very liberally towards
the crusade against French revolutionary principles.</p>
<p>The maturer efforts of Shrewsbury have not been unworthy the
zeal of its youth.&nbsp; When the tocsin of invasion was sounded
through the vast dominions of France, and the existence of
Britain as an independent nation, was threatened with extinction,
the inhabitants of Shrewsbury stepped forward with a noble
enthusiasm, in defence of their lives, their liberty and,
laws:</p>
<blockquote><p>Types of a race, who shall th&rsquo; invader
scorn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As rocks resist the billows round their shore:<br />
Types of a race who shall to time unborn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their country leave unconquer&rsquo;d as of
yore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A regiment of foot, called the Shrewsbury Volunteers, was
formed.&nbsp; It consisted of seven companies of eighty men each,
chiefly tradesmen, clothed at an expence of about &pound;3,000,
raised by voluntary contribution in the town.&nbsp; Besides this
corps, which was commanded by Sir Charles Oakley, Bart., two
companies were raised in the town by B. Benyon, and J. Sutton,
esq.&rsquo;s which were attached to that fine regiment the
Shropshire Volunteers, under the command of colonel Kynaston
Powell, M.P.; and three troops <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>of Cavalry commanded by the
honourable William Hill.&nbsp; And had an allwise Providence
permitted the invader to set his unhallowed foot on the shores of
Britain, there is no doubt but each individual was determined
that the spot on which he contended in defence of the noble
institutions of his country should have been the throne of his
triumph or his grave.</p>
<p>The promptitude with which these associations and others of
the same nature throughout the empire, united in the hour of
public danger&mdash;the fatigues they underwent in acquiring a
knowledge of the use of arms&mdash;the readiness evinced in the
abandonment of their private concerns for the public
safety&mdash;and the inconveniences and expenses which they
incurred on the occasion, surely demanded some other reward than
to have their ardour damped by the change in the system of
national defence; for to whom in the hour of battle could the
protection of their homes and their families, the independence of
their country, the sepulchres of their fathers, and the sanctuary
of their God, be better entrusted than to those whose courage was
animated and strengthened by the most endearing
recollections?&nbsp; But such sacrifices, even when the necessity
of them was superseded, will not be forgotten&mdash;the
remembrance of them will live in the minds of their grateful and
admiring countrymen, and their services will form a splendid,
monument on the page of history.</p>
<p>Nor have the inhabitants been insensible to the miseries
attendant on those whose relatives have fallen sacrifices to the
heroism and devotion which they displayed during the sanguinary
battles of the last twenty years, having very largely contributed
to alleviate the wants of their widows and orphans.</p>
<p>The affection and loyalty of the inhabitants of Shrewsbury to
their venerable Sovereign was most <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>conspicuously displayed on the
National Jubilee, the 25th of October, 1809, the fiftieth
anniversary of his Majesty&rsquo;s accession to the crown.&nbsp;
On this occasion, liberal subscriptions were entered into for the
purpose of discharging the debts of persons in the court of
conscience&mdash;for relieving the distresses of the sick poor,
&amp;c. &amp;c.&nbsp; Joy beamed in every countenance, and
gratitude filled every heart.&nbsp; A congratulatory address had
been previously voted unanimously, in a general meeting of the
inhabitants convened by the mayor.&mdash;We give the following
abridged account of the celebration of the day from the <span
class="smcap">Shrewsbury Chronicle</span> of October
27:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Never, perhaps, has any national occurrence taken
place which can afford in retrospect so rich and amiable a
gratification as that of Wednesday last.&nbsp; If we contemplate
that a general amnesty was proclaimed to all delinquents in our
army&mdash;that a national banquet was ordered for the brave
fellows in our navy&mdash;that the prisons in many places were
thrown open to the debtors&mdash;that there was no such thing,
perhaps in the land, as an hungry honest man&mdash;and, lastly,
that our places of worship were thronged by a people, who, like
sons and daughters, had assembled to give thanks to the Almighty
for the preservation of the life of their political parent:
scarcely could the imagination conceive a happier variety of
circumstances from which the mind may derive such sublime
enjoyment.&nbsp; How conspicuous on this event has been the
attribute of Englishmen&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Generosity</span>!&nbsp; And let us also reflect,
how much good had been omitted to be done, and how much evil had
been produced, if the sums voluntarily subscribed by the people
of this kingdom had been squandered in acts of sensuality, and
riotous illuminations.&nbsp; Instead of which, the hungry have
been filled, the moneyless relieved, and the captive set
free.</p>
<p><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>In
deeds of this description, the inhabitants of <span
class="GutSmall">THIS TOWN</span> have never been
deficient.&nbsp; The subscriptions amount to between &pound;400
and &pound;500, and the committee has been indefatigable in
proposing, and in executing, the best plans in the distribution
of it.</p>
<p>The mode of distribution, fixed upon at a Meeting of the
Subscribers, is as follows:&mdash;A sum not exceeding 50 Guineas
to be applied in the discharge of persons now in the court of
conscience, under the direction of a committee.&mdash;The like
sum to be applied by the same committee in discharging or
compounding debts of other poor persons within the town.&mdash;A
like sum to be applied in the relief of poor sick persons within
the town, under the direction of a committee.&mdash;The
distribution of these sums to take place on or before the 25th of
December next.&mdash;The Directors of the House of Industry to be
recommended to make what addition they shall think proper, on the
25th instant, to the ordinary allowance of the poor and aged
people under their care.&mdash;Five Guineas to be given to the
ringers; and 7<i>s.</i> to each housekeeper in St. Chad&rsquo;s,
St. Mary&rsquo;s, and St. Giles&rsquo;s almshouses.&mdash;The
remainder given on Tuesday evening (the 24th) to proper
persons&mdash;one half to St. Chad&rsquo;s parish, and the
remaining half in the other four parishes.&mdash;Each subscriber
to have a right to recommend two persons for each guinea
subscribed.</p>
<p>The dawning of Wednesday morning was saluted by ringing of
bells; while, from the barges on the Severn, decorated with
laurels and flags, which were suspended from their yard-arms and
top-masts, the bellowing of cannon was incessantly heard.&nbsp;
Shops were closed, and business seemed suspended.&nbsp; At
eleven, the mayor and corporation, preceded by their officers,
and the wardens and many members of every company of tradesmen,
accompanied by their flags and streamers, walked in procession to
the church of St. Chad, the band playing God save the King.&nbsp;
The sermon was preached by the Rev. Mr. Nunn, from the 11th
Nehemiah, 3d verse, &ldquo;Let the king live for ever;&rdquo; and
the service concluded by singing &ldquo;God save the
King.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sermons were also delivered to crowded
congregations at every place of worship in the town.&nbsp; The
doors of many of the principal in <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>habitants were ornamented with
laurel; at night, fire-works were exhibited from the gardens of
Benyon, Esq. and Dr. Evans, and bonfires distinctly descried on
the remote eminences of the Wrekin, Haughmond Hill, Grinshill,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>We shall conclude by repeating the sentiment, that the future
historian, dwelling upon the character of <span class="smcap">his
Majesty</span>, will, by this day, be released from the trouble
of much prolixity.&nbsp; The character of George the Third has
been drawn by his people in this spontaneous expression of their
sentiments.&nbsp; After a reign of half a century, they rose with
one accordant voice, and desired with prayer and praise, with
thanks and rejoicings, with deeds of benevolence and charity to
all their fellow subjects, to express their gratitude to <span
class="smcap">God</span> for having given them so good a King,
and for having spared his life so long.</p>
<p>One remark will surely occur to every person who reads this
and other accounts of the universal spirit that has pervaded the
bosoms of Englishmen on this occasion:&mdash;If the strength of a
state center in the virtue of its people; the virtue of a people
in affection for their sovereign, and a reciprocal love, link
both together, then is England powerful indeed!&nbsp; &lsquo;What
shall subdue this spirit?&rsquo;</p>

41</span>Description of the Town.</h2>
<h3>PUBLIC BUILDINGS.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> entering on our general
description of the town, its public buildings naturally claim the
first share of attention.&nbsp; They will be found classed under
the heads of Public, Religious, and Charitable erections, and
noticed under that order: and whether we consider them in the
accommodation which they present for the transaction of the
business respectively carried on in them, for the antiquity of
some, or for the elegance of their erection, they will no doubt
prove sources of recreation to, and well worthy the inspection
of, the stranger.</p>
<h4>The Castle</h4>
<p>Is supposed to have been founded by Roger de Montgomery, about
the year 1068.&nbsp; It continued in his family until the reign
of Henry I, when by the rebellion of earl Robert de Belesme it
was forfeited to the king, who committed the care of it to a
constable, usually the sheriff, it being then extremely useful
for the defence of the adjacent country.</p>
<p>This ancient fortress is built of red stone, on the N.E. part
of the isthmus on which the town stands, and being erected on a
commanding eminence, was <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>admirably calculated to &ldquo;roll
back the tide of war&rdquo; and to defend Shrewsbury from the
frequent incursions of the neighbouring Welsh, who were
continually devastating the surrounding country.&nbsp; When the
incorporation of the principality with the English dominions took
place, it ceased to enjoy the importance which its situation on
the Welsh border had previously given to it; and after
experiencing a variety of changes in its masters, it was granted
by Charles II. to lord Newport, afterwards earl of Bradford;
since which period it became the property of the late venerable
sir William Pulteney, bart. who greatly repaired and rendered it
a comfortable residence.&nbsp; Sir William at his death
bequeathed it to the right honourable the earl of Darlington, its
present possessor.</p>
<p>The history of the Town and the Castle are so intimately
connected, that we shall content ourselves with giving a brief
description of its ancient and present appearance.&nbsp;
According to Leland, it was fast hastening to decay in the reign
of Henry VIII. and indeed it has suffered so much from the
ravages of time, rather than from those of war, that it is
doubtful what idea to form of its original size; but it is at
least probable, when its importance as a border fortress is
considered, that it occupied a much larger space than that marked
out by its existing walls.</p>
<p>The only buildings remaining are the keep, the walls of the
inner court, and the great arch of the interior gate; they are
built of red stone, and the former has been converted into a
commodious and pleasant dwelling, and is at present occupied by
J. C. Pelham, esq.&nbsp; It consists of two round towers of equal
diameter, embattled and pierced, connected by a square building
about 100 feet in length and about the same in height, in which
are many spacious and <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>excellent rooms.&nbsp; At the
entrance, which opens on a newly-erected grand staircase, is a
statue of Roger de Montgomery.&nbsp; The arch of the gateway is
about 18 feet high, semicircular, and with plain round
facings.&nbsp; Its walls appear to have sustained a tower, from
whence hung the portcullis.&nbsp; The area of the court has
latterly been cleared of its buildings, and is now formed into a
beautiful garden.&nbsp; On the circular grass-plot in front of
the castle, the newly-elected knights of the shire are girt with
their swords by the sheriff, which, as it is an ancient custom,
is still permitted, although the castle and its grounds are
private property.</p>
<p>In the south corner of this court is a lofty mount, on which
is erected a watch tower, now converted into a pleasant summer
room, from which is commanded a grand and diversified prospect of
uncommon richness and beauty.&nbsp; The mount, rising abruptly
from the margin of the Severn, crowned with its venerable tower,
its bold and abrupt bank being richly clothed with the foliage of
various species of trees and skirled by the majestic stream which
rolls at its base, has also, when viewed from a distance, a
beautiful and picturesque appearance.&nbsp; Shrewsbury, though
the most important station on the Welsh border, and though
frequently thrown into possession of its enemies, never sustained
more than two sieges.&nbsp; Its natural and artificial strength
might probably deter an adverse army from investing it in a
regular way, for it was protected not only by its castle, but
by</p>
<h4>Walls,</h4>
<p>fenced with towers which completely surrounded it.</p>
<p>The first stone rampart extended only across the isthmus to
the river on each side, and was raised by <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>Robert de
Belesme.&nbsp; In the reign of Henry III. the inhabitants of this
place having suffered greatly during the rebellion of the earl of
Pembroke, were exhorted to secure themselves by building a wall
entirely round the town, which, by the aid of the royal bounty,
was accomplished in 32 years.&nbsp; An additional rampart, by
order of Oliver Cromwell, was constructed, as it is said, from
the materials of Shrawardine castle, and extended from the wall
of earl Robert at the river&rsquo;s brink to the Welsh bridge:
though now ruinous it forms a tolerable connecting path between
the northern and western ends of the town.&mdash;Of the old
ramparts, those on the northern and eastern sides of the town
have long since disappeared; their foundations, which are easy to
be traced, form the groundwork of modern houses.&nbsp; On the
south, a considerable portion remains, and part of it is kept in
repair as a public walk; but it retains little of its original
appearance, having been considerably lowered, and entirely
stripped of its battlements.&nbsp; The towers have been all taken
down except one, which stands on this wall, between the bottom of
Swan Hill and Belmont.&nbsp; It is square and embattled, and has
two stories, the entrance of the higher being from the top of the
wall, through a small pointed arch, which does not appear of
older date than the time of Henry IV.&nbsp; The town, according
to Leland, who beheld its fortifications entire, was more than a
mile in compass; which extent may probably be a third more in
modern computation.&nbsp; There were formerly three principal</p>
<h4>Gates</h4>
<p>to Shrewsbury; one near the Castle called the North Gate, and
one on each of the bridges; that on the east called the Abbey
Gate, and that on the west the Welsh Gate.&nbsp; A part of the
southern tower of the <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>north gate is the only remain of
these once formidable fortifications.</p>
<h4>The Town Hall</h4>
<p>Is situated in High Street, and was erected in 1785 from a
design by Mr. Haycock of this town, at an expense of
&pound;11,000, which was raised by a county rate.</p>
<p>It is an elegant structure of free stone, presenting a
handsome front to the street.&nbsp; On the front of the pediment,
which is supported by four lofty columns of the Ionic order, is a
fine figure of Justice in <i>bas relief</i>, seated on a rock,
beneath which, over the centre door, are the arms of the town
handsomely ornamented with appropriate emblems.</p>
<p>The ground floor consists of a vestibule and two courts, in
which the assizes for the county are held.&nbsp; Under the one
appropriated to the crown bar, is a cell, for the reception of
prisoners.&nbsp; A beautiful spiral stone staircase leads to the
higher story, where is a large room intended for county meetings,
one for the use of the grand jury of the county, with record and
other offices for the use of the county and town.</p>
<p>The grand jury room is decorated with portraits of George I.
given by Mr. Edward Elisha; of George II. given by Thomas
Wingfield, esq.; of George III. and queen Charlotte, given by sir
Thomas Jones, bart.; and one of the gallant and celebrated
admiral Benbow, given by his sister, Mrs. Elizabeth Hind.</p>
<p>Immediately adjoining is</p>
<h4>The Market House.</h4>
<p>From an inscription over the northern arch it appears that</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>&ldquo;The XVth day of June was this building begun,
William Jones and Thomas Charlton, Gent. then Bailiffs, and was
erected and covered in their time 1595.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is built entirely of free stone, and is one of the largest
of similar erections in the kingdom.&nbsp; In the centre of the
principal front, which faces the west, is a spacious portal, over
which are the arms of queen Elizabeth in high relief.&nbsp;
Attached to the imposts of the great arch are pillars, supporting
each the figure of a lion bearing a shield on its breast.&nbsp;
Above are two stories, with large square mullioned windows.&nbsp;
On each side this portal is an open arcade, consisting of three
spacious round arches, which form the main building, over which
is a range of square windows with mullions, and a very rich
parapet, consisting of a series of embrazures carved like the
Ionic volute, between which at alternate distances, are a kind of
grotesque pinnacles in the same style.&nbsp; At the north and
south ends are large open arches, the whole edifice being
finished above by sharp pointed gables.</p>
<p>The ground floor of this building is appropriated to the corn
market, and is 105 feet long by 24 feet wide.&nbsp; A room over
of similar size was formerly rented by the company of drapers,
and used by them for a flannel market on Thursdays; but the sale
of that staple article of Welsh manufacture having been removed
to Welsh Pool, it has been rented of late as an
ironmonger&rsquo;s warehouse.&nbsp; Over the northern arch is
placed the statue of Richard duke of York, removed hence from the
old bridge in 1791, as appears by the inscription at his right
hand: on his left are the arms of the town finely sculptured in
relief.</p>
<p>Its spacious area is a useful promenade for the inhabitants in
bad weather, and its architecture is a fine specimen of the
fantastic style of the 16th century.</p>
<h4><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>Lord
Hill&rsquo;s Column.</h4>
<p>The splendid achievements of the British army in Spain and
Portugal from 1808 to 1814, together with the disastrous retreat
of Napoleon from his Russian campaign, and the subsequent
occupation of France by the allied troops, having produced a
general peace, a proposition appeared in the Shrewsbury Chronicle
of December the 17th, 1813, by the Proprietor of that paper, to
erect some suitable memorial of the prominent part lord Hill had
acted throughout the whole of those eventful campaigns.&mdash;At
a meeting in the News Room on the following day, nearly
&pound;400 was subscribed to carry this intention into
effect.&nbsp; Subsequently, however, it was determined to extend
the original plan, a meeting of the inhabitants of the town was
called, and it was resolved to solicit subscriptions generally
from all who participated in the triumphs of their country, or
who felt any respect for the brilliant and varied services of the
gallant general.</p>
<p>After a variety of plans had been proposed it was at length
determined to erect the column now under notice.&nbsp; The first
stone was laid on the 27th of December, 1814, agreeably to
masonic rule, by Richard Phillips, esq. master of the Salopian
Lodge, and at that time mayor of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; The foundation
stone, which weighed four tons and a half, is of the following
dimensions, viz: length 11 feet 3 inches, breadth 3 feet, and 2
feet thick.&nbsp; In a cavity underneath, a bottle was deposited,
containing gold and silver coins of George III. accompanied with
the <span class="smcap">Shrewsbury Chronicle</span> of the
preceding Friday.&nbsp; Over the cavity was a plate bearing the
following</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><i>INSCRIPTION</i></p>
<p>Of this Column, intended to be erected to commemorate the
brilliant achievements of Lieutenant-General <span
class="smcap">Rowland Lord Hill</span>, Knight of the Bath, and
Knight of the Tower and Sword.</p>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>The
first Stone was laid by <span class="smcap">Richard
Phillips</span>, Esquire, Mayor of Shrewsbury, and Matter of the
Salopian Lodge of free and accepted Masons, assisted by the
Chaplain, Wardens, the Brethren of this and Deputies from other
Lodges, upon the 27th Day of December, in the year of our Lord,
1814, and in the year of Masonry&mdash;5814, being the
<i>Festival of St. John</i>.&nbsp; The funds for this beautiful
Memorial, in honour of splendid talent and private worth, were
furnished by a public Subscription, raised chiefly by the
inhabitants of the town and county of Salop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The column is situated on a rising ground, at the entrance of
this town from the London and Bath roads.&nbsp; From its
insulated and lofty situation, it is seen from many parts of the
town, and is conspicuous at a considerable distance in the
country.</p>

</table>
<p>Solidity and durability have been particularly attended to in
its construction, the stones with which it has been built, being
as large as could conveniently be raised, from an excellent
quarry at Grinshill, in the neighbourhood of Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>The pedestal is square, standing upon two steps, having a
large pier or buttress at each angle, upon which are placed Lions
couchant.&nbsp; The piers are formed of three stones in each, the
top one of each on which the lions are placed, being 10 feet 6
inches long, 4 feet 3 inches wide, and 3 feet 3 inches deep, and
their weight 10 tons.&nbsp; The lower diameter of the column is
15 feet, and the masonry 2 feet 3 inches in thickness; the top
diameter 10 feet 6 inches, by 1 foot 6 inches in thickness.&nbsp;
Each course of stones is 3 <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>feet high, six stones form the
course.&nbsp; There are 326 stones in the whole structure, and
the top stone immediately under the statue, weighs two and a half
tons.&nbsp; There are 17,993 cubic feet in the whole, and its
weight is 1120 tons.&nbsp; There is a beautiful staircase up the
shaft, the view of the surrounding country from the top, being
most extensive.&nbsp; The expense was about &pound;5,500.</p>
<p>The proportion of this column is half a diameter higher than
those in the portico of the celebrated Parthenon at Athens, and
is <span class="smcap">the largest Greek doric column in the
world</span>.&nbsp; The figure is designed and executed by
Messrs. Coade and Sealy, of London, in their artificial stone,
which is so well calculated to resist the action of the
weather.&nbsp; The lions are worked in Grinshill stone, by Mr.
Carline of this place.&nbsp; The contractors were the late Mr.
Simpson, and Mr. Lawrence: owing to the death of the former the
contract devolved upon his successor Mr. Straphen.&nbsp; The
original design is by Mr. Edward Haycock, architect, of this
town, with some alterations in the pedestal by Mr. Harrison, of
Chester.</p>
<h4>The Town &amp; County Goal.</h4>
<p>This building, a pleasant and admirably constructed brick
edifice, was finished in 1793, at the expense of about
&pound;30,000, on a plan furnished by Mr. Haycock, architect, of
this town.&nbsp; It was erected in consequence of the light
diffused on the subject of prisons by the later philanthropic Mr.
Howard, the old gaol being (says Mr. Howard) &ldquo;both wretched
in its accommodations, and a complete school of vice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prison is situate on the banks of the river, on a dry
gravelly soil on the south-east side of the town, in the
immediate vicinity of the castle, and is spacious, airy, <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>well supplied
with water, and as comfortable as these abodes of human
misfortune and depravity possibly can be.</p>
<p>The entrance is through a free stone gateway, having a lodge
on each side, over the arch of which is a fine bust of Howard,
presented by the late Rowland Hunt, and Thomas Knight, esquires,
two county magistrates.&nbsp; There are reception cells in the
lodges for the examination of the persons by the surgeon previous
to their being lodged in the different apartments; during their
continuance in the prison, criminals wear a woollen jacket,
waistcoat and cap, composed of blue and yellow stripes before
conviction, after which the dress is changed for one of brown and
yellow.&nbsp; All executions take place on the flat roof of the
northern lodge, when all the criminals are brought into the area
before the governor&rsquo;s house to witness the awful
scene.&nbsp; This house, in which is an apartment for the
magistrates, faces the entrance gate, in the centre of the west
front of the prison.&nbsp; The chapel, which is a neat octagonal
structure, well calculated for the important purposes of its
erection, stands in the centre of the whole building, and is so
arranged that every class of prisoners is separated and hid from
each other, though all may see the officiating clergyman.&nbsp;
The prison, the boundary wall of which encloses two acres of
ground, and is 16 feet high, is divided into four principal
courts, besides smaller ones, and not only are the sexes
separated, but each description of prisoners are subdivided, into
classes, which have each their respective courts and day
rooms.&nbsp; The debtor&rsquo;s rooms are airy and comfortable,
commanding many pleasing views of the adjacent country.&nbsp; At
the eastern extremity is the infirmary, near which the under
keeper resides, who has constantly for sale various articles
manufactured <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>by the prisoners, the profits of which are applied for
their benefit.</p>
<p>Closely allied to the superior construction of the prison are
the excellent and judicious regulations for its internal
management, which, whilst they tend to ameliorate the condition
of the unhappy sufferers, are calculated to reclaim their vicious
habits; and should they return to the bosom of society, stimulate
them to atone for their depredations on their fellow-creatures,
by their honest and exemplary deportment in future.&nbsp; Prayers
are read every Thursday, and a sermon preached every Sunday by
the chaplain, and the justices appointed at the quarter sessions
visit the different apartments of the prison when they please,
and have the power of making any alteration in the mode of
treating the criminals which to them may appear judicious.</p>
<p>Convinced that the design of punishment is to prevent the
commission of crimes, and to repair the injury that has thereby
been done to society or the individual, and that it is the duty
of every good government to <i>reform</i> rather than
<i>exterminate</i> offenders, the exertions of the late Rowland
Hunt, esq. were directed to the formation of the following
excellent plan, which was instituted in 1797.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>First</i>&mdash;To enable debtors to gain a
livelihood while in confinement; to reward their industry and
good behaviour while there; and to furnish them with some
implements or materials on quitting prison, the better to support
themselves and their families on their return to society.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>&mdash;To encourage industry, penitence, and
orderly behaviour in criminal prisoners; and to furnish with
clothes and implements those who on quitting prison receive a
certificate of good behaviour.</p>
<p><i>Thirdly</i>&mdash;To provide all those who are dismissed,
with a small sum for immediate maintenance, to prevent the great
temptation of committing a crime for that purpose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>This
praiseworthy charity, the subscriptions to which from the county
at large amount to about &pound;80 yearly; also distributes
bibles and prayer books to the wretched objects of its bounty,
and thus endeavours to impress on the minds of these outcasts of
society, the sacred lessons of divine wisdom.&nbsp; The
benevolent stranger will perceive in the large outer gate of the
prison, two small apertures, and on the other side two boxes are
affixed, into one of which he may drop his mite, &ldquo;to
prisoners in a state of reformation,&rdquo; and in the other
&ldquo;to debtors in a state of industry.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>The Military Depot,</h4>
<p>Is a very handsome brick edifice, erected by government in the
year 1806, from a design by Mr. Wyatt, at an expense of about
&pound;10,000.&nbsp; It stands in a piece of ground near St.
Giles&rsquo;s Church, at the east end of the Abbeyforegate.</p>
<p>The principal building is 135 feet by 39, in two stories, and
is capable of containing 25,000 stand of arms.&nbsp; Within the
enclosure are two magazines for ammunition, and a small neat
house at each angle for the storekeeper, armourer, and
subalterns&rsquo; guard.&mdash;It was intended for the reception
of the arms of the volunteer corps of Shropshire and the
adjoining counties, but until lately very few arms of any
description have been deposited here&mdash;in fact it has been a
complete sinecure.&nbsp; Mr. Linton is the present governor.</p>
<h4>The English, or East Bridge,</h4>
<p>Called also the Stone Bridge, which connects the suburb of
Abbey-foregate with the town, was finished in 1774, from a plan
produced by Mr. Gwyn, at an expense of &pound;16,000 raised by
public subscription.&nbsp; <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>This bridge, which is 400 feet in
length, is built of Grinshill free stone, on seven semicircular
arches, and crowned with a fine balustrade.&nbsp; The central
arch is 60 feet in width, and 40 in height from the bed of the
river, the two arches at the extremities being 35 feet wide and
20 high.&nbsp; The breadth between the balustrades is 20
feet.&mdash;On the northern front is the head of Sabrina in bas
relief and the date of its erection.&nbsp; Its ornaments are
tasteful, and it may justly be classed among the most elegant
modern erections in the empire.&nbsp; Some persons, probably, may
conceive that the elevation of the centre is too great, but when
they are informed that in the memorable flood of 1795, even the
great arch was not more than capacious enough to admit the
torrent, they will no doubt be inclined to praise rather than
censure the artist, who was actuated by a desire to blend the
useful with the ornamental.</p>
<h4>The Welsh Bridge,</h4>
<p>Built in the opposite direction to the before named structure,
and which received its name as being the grand route into Wales,
was finished in 1795, from a design by Messrs. Tilly and Carline
of this place.&nbsp; It consists of five spacious arches with
balustrades above, and is 266 feet in length, with a driving road
20 feet wide, and paved on each side, for the convenience of foot
passengers, 5 feet.&nbsp; It is a plain though neat erection, and
has a remarkably solid and substantial appearance.</p>
<h4>Public Subscription Library,</h4>
<p>Situated on St. John&rsquo;s Hill, is a plain brick edifice,
formerly a private house, and has been lately purchased by the
Committee of the above institution, and fitted up for the purpose
of lodging the books belonging <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>to the Society.&nbsp; The number of
subscribers is about 140, who pay annually &pound;1. 11s. 6d. and
2 guineas entrance; but their shares are transferable.&nbsp; The
managers of the society are a president, a treasurer, a committee
of twelve, who sit gratuitously, and a librarian at a
stipend.&nbsp; The following are some of the principal laws and
regulations:&mdash;The library is open for the free use of
subscribers five hours every day at the rooms, with the right of
having several books at one time at their own houses, a certain
number of days.&nbsp; Forfeits are established and rigorously
enforced for detaining and damaging of books.&mdash;The method of
admitting books is, for any member to write down the title, size
and price at the library, with his signature, one clear week
before the monthly meeting, at which period it will be ordered,
if the majority of the subscribers present are agreeable.</p>
<p>The society which has been instituted about forty years, now
possesses 5000 volumes&mdash;a valuable mass of general
literature in every department.&nbsp; Neither divinity nor law
has been permitted to <i>load</i> the shelves; and in the matter
of that great stumbling block of mixed associations,
<i>politics</i>, a due regard to that invaluable maxim
&ldquo;audi alteram partem,&rdquo; has never been forgot or
violated, and diversity of opinion has only promoted the
successful progress of the establishment.</p>
<h4>Subscription Coffee Room</h4>
<p>Is attached to the county-hall, and is supplied with several
London and provincial papers.</p>
<h4>Chronicle News-Room.</h4>
<p>This is situate on St. John&rsquo;s Hill, and forms part of
the Library House.&nbsp; It is furnished not only with a very
extensive variety of London and Provincial <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>Newspapers
and the Gazette, but also with Reviews, Magazine, Army and Navy
Lists, and the best Pamphlets of the day, &amp;c.</p>
<p>To each of these institutions strangers are admitted on being
introduced by a subscriber.</p>
<p>Beside these institutions there are several private <span
class="smcap">Reading Societies</span> in the town.</p>
<h4>New Church of St. Chad.</h4>
<p>This church, situated near that beautiful promenade the
Quarry, is erected in a style highly ornamental, from a design by
Mr. Stuart, an architect from London.&nbsp; The admirable
execution of the masonry, and the beauty of the stone, have an
extremely elegant appearance.&nbsp; The first stone was laid on
the 2d of March, 1790, and the building was consecrated on the
28th of August, 1792.&nbsp; The body of the church is a rotunda,
100 feet in diameter, having a fine steeple at its south-east
end.&nbsp; In the steeple is an octagonal belfry, containing a
melodious peal of twelve bells, surmounted by a small dome,
supported on eight Corinthian pillars.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p55b.jpg">
<img alt=
"St. Chad&rsquo;s church"
title=
"St. Chad&rsquo;s church"
 src="images/p55s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The principal entrance is through the large door under the
steeple, to the lower division of which is attached a portico,
elevated on a flight of steps, and supported by four Doric
columns.&nbsp; The interior has a rich and noble appearance,
especially since its recent painting, which in some measure has
corrected that light and theatrical effect hitherto complained
of.&nbsp; The gallery which encircles the whole of the church,
except the chancel, is supported by a double circular range of
short pillars with Ionic capitals.&nbsp; From its front rises a
series of columns which support the roof, intended to imitate the
Corinthian order.&nbsp; The chancel is separated from the church
by two insulated Corinthian-columns, with highly enriched <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>architraves.&nbsp; Beside the usual appendages of a
chancel, the Creed, Commandments, and Lord&rsquo;s Prayer&mdash;a
fine painted window, executed by Eginton, and removed here from
Lichfield cathedral, was erected in the large window, in 1807, at
the expense of the parishioners.&mdash;The subject is the
resurrection of our Saviour, from a design by West.&nbsp; In the
gallery is a good organ.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the objections which have been made to the
architectural plan of this church, it is possessed of one
advantage, which, it is presumed tends to obviate all of them,
namely convenient accommodation for a congregation of 2000
persons, which should be the object principally kept in view in
all similar erections.&nbsp; It was built at an expense of about
&pound;18,000: &pound;15,000 of which remains as a debt, on the
church at this period.</p>
<p>The patron of the living is the king&mdash;the present vicar,
the Rev. Thomas Stedman, M.A.&nbsp; Organist Mr. John Wynne.</p>
<p>From the dome of this church there is a most beautiful
panoramic view of the town, and a very extensive range of the
fertile plain of Shropshire.</p>
<h4>The Abbey of St. Peter &amp; St. Paul.</h4>
<p>The present church once formed part of a magnificent and
richly endowed abbey, founded by Roger de Montgomery, soon after
the Norman conquest.&nbsp; Here that powerful baron, in the
decline of his life, retired, relinquishing his warlike habits
for the severities of the Benedictine monks, and adopting the
custom mentioned by Milton, of those</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who,
to be sure of Paradise,<br />
Dying, put on the weeds of Dominic,<br />
Or in Franciscan think to pass disguised.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>Originally it was of very considerable extent,
comprehending within its enclosure nearly nine acres, now used as
gardens and pleasure grounds to the adjoining mansions, together
with a spacious fish-pond.</p>
<p>This once celebrated structure, in common with others similar
in their institution, suffered considerable dilapidations in the
reign of Henry the eighth.&nbsp; In consequence of this and the
mouldering waste of time, a small portion only remains, and what
does exist has been cruelly mutilated in its repairs; its nave,
western tower and northern porch, being the only fragments left
to tell the history of its pristine magnificence and
grandeur.&nbsp; The tower is a finely proportioned structure; its
portal has a round Norman arch deeply recessed, and another of a
pointed form, inserted within it at some subsequent period.&nbsp;
Above this is one of the noblest windows in the kingdom, its
height being 46 feet by 22 feet wide.&nbsp; It is divided by its
mulliens into seven &ldquo;days&rdquo;, or compartments below, of
which there are two tiers, and its arched head is sharp pointed,
and filled with a profusion of the most delicate tracery.&nbsp;
On each side is a mouldering nich, in one of which was a statue
of St. Peter, and in the other St. Paul.&nbsp; Between the double
bell windows in front, is the figure of an armed knight within a
nich, supposed from its surrounding decorations and ornaments, to
represent that celebrated warrior, Edward III.&nbsp; The tower
contains eight bells.&nbsp; Within the arch which once led to the
south wing of the transept, is an ancient figure clad in mail,
supposed by some, to be intended to perpetuate the memory of earl
Roger, the munificent patron of the abbey, and to this effect an
inscription was placed within the tomb, by the heralds at their
visitation of this county, in 1633.&nbsp; Others <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>suppose it to
belong to some other warrior of subsequent times, monuments of
this description not being known at such an early period.</p>
<p>The ravages which this venerable pile has suffered are,
perhaps, more strikingly visible in its interior than its
exterior; but it still presents a solemn and majestic appearance,
and whilst it proudly reminds us of its ancient grandeur, awfully
forewarns us of &ldquo;another and a better
world.&rdquo;&mdash;The altar-piece is in the style of the last
century, with paintings of Moses and Aaron, and finishes the east
end.</p>
<p>There are several monuments and inscriptions in memory of the
Prynces, Baldwins, Reckes, and many other ancient and respectable
Salopian families.&nbsp; The armorial bearings in the great west
window, were restored A.D. 1815, from an ancient drawing in the
Herald&rsquo;s Office.&nbsp; The east window is also adorned with
painted glass.&nbsp; In the center compartment, under gothic
canopies, are large figures of St. Peter and St. Paul, with their
appropriate symbols; above are the arms of England, the see of
Lichfield, the Founder of the Abbey, and of Lord Berwick, the
munificent donor of the window; on each side are escutcheons of
the vicars from the year 1500.&nbsp; The bones of St. Winyfred
were deposited in this abbey with great splendour, in the reign
of Stephen.</p>
<p>The organ and the handsome gothic screen on which it stands,
were erected in 1806.&nbsp; It is a very fine instrument, made by
Mr. Gray, of London, and cost 365 guineas.&nbsp; On the screen
are the arms of the principal benefactors.</p>
<p>In the parish chest are two small oval seals exactly similar
in their dimensions, impresses and legends.&nbsp; Two clothed
arms issue from the opposite sides of the area, one bearing a
crosier, the other a naked sword; in the centre, a wand or staff
of office.&nbsp; Inscription, <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>&ldquo;Sigillum commune de Fforyate
Monachor&rdquo;&mdash;the common seal of Monks Foregate.&nbsp;
Some of our most skilful antiquaries are unable to give a
sufficient reason why Monks Foregate came to have a common
seal.&nbsp; Some of them have supposed that the parish might have
obtained a charter of incorporation, while others think that it
might have been assumed without authority.&nbsp; Neither of the
two seals appear much older than the 15th century.</p>
<p>The patron of the living is Lord Berwick&mdash;the Rev. H.
Burton, vicar, and Mr. John Amott, organist.</p>
<p>But the remain of this abbey which has most excited the
attention of antiquaries, is a beautiful little structure on the
south side of the gardens.&nbsp; Its plan is octagon, 6 feet in
diameter.&nbsp; Some broken steps which did not belong to it
originally, lead through a narrow flat arched door on the east,
to the inside.&nbsp; The south part stands on a fragment of the
ruins.&nbsp; The corresponding side projects considerably from
the wall, resting upon a single corbel, terminating in a
head.&nbsp; From this point it gradually swells, bound with a
multitude of delicate ribbed mouldings, until it forms the
basement under the floor.&nbsp; An obtuse dome of stone is
suspended over the whole, at about eight feet from the base,
supported on six narrow pointed arches, rising from pillars
similar to the mullions of the windows.&nbsp; One of the
remaining sides of the octagon is a solid blank wall, and in the
other is a door.&nbsp; The roof within is vaulted on eight ribs,
which spring from the wall immediately under the cavity of the
dome.&nbsp; At their crossing in the centre is a boss, bearing a
representation of the crucifixion, considerably relieved.&nbsp;
The spaces between the divisions of the three northern arches,
four feet above the bottom, are filled up with <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>stone
pannels, over which they are entirely open, a circumstance which,
by permitting the light, is productive of a beautiful
effect.&nbsp; On the centre pannel are two small figures in
elegant tabernacles; in one of these is the figure of an angel,
in the other, that of a woman, whom he is addressing; the whole
seems intended to represent the annunciation.&nbsp; The right
hand pannel is embellished with images of St. Peter and St. Paul
bearing their respective symbols, with similar enrichments, and
that on the left has two figures in monastic habits, one of them
a female, probably St. Winyfred, the other a monk; the height of
every figure is eighteen inches.&nbsp; The arches on the southern
side are without ornaments, and are now quite open two feet from
the floor.</p>
<p>In forming a garden on the site of the Abbey Cloisters, a
great variety of fragments were met with, consisting of painted
tiles with various devices, rich gothic tracery, window mullions,
&amp;c. and a very beautiful part of the pavement of the
refectory; this, from its situation, being about 23 feet from the
line of the outer refectory wall, and being part of the border of
a pavement, satisfactorily proves the use to which this beautiful
Gothic pulpit was applied, it being a custom in Benedictine
monasteries, for one monk to read to the others during their
meals in the refectory.&nbsp; In a parallel line, and at 12 feet
distance from the wall of the dormitory, a considerable number of
small Norman capitals and bases were found, strongly bedded in
cement, and forming a foundation to some superstructure.&nbsp; As
the west side of the cloisters must have occupied this situation,
it may be presumed that there were cloisters of more ancient
architecture, than these destroyed at the Reformation, to which
the fragments found in the garden belonged.</p>

<h4><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>St.
Marys Church.</h4>
<p>This venerable church is situated on a parallel with
Castle-street, at the north-east part of the town, in a small
area; and with the exception of St. Giles&rsquo;, is the only
structure of this place, which has been handed down to the
present time in an entire state.&nbsp; It is built in the form of
a cross, consisting of a nave side isles, transept, choir and its
chapels, with a west steeple.&nbsp; The exterior presents various
styles of ancient architecture.&nbsp; The basement of the tower
is of red stone, and contains the small round-headed windows of
the early Norman era.&nbsp; From the bell story the pointed style
takes place, and is of the grey free stone of Grinshill quarry,
as is also the greatest part of the fabric.&nbsp; The tower is
large, but low.&nbsp; The upper story has on every side handsome
double windows.&nbsp; From the tower rises a lofty and beautiful
spire.&nbsp; The windows of the lower parts bear the remains of
rich spiring canopies and pinnacles.&nbsp; The height of the
tower is 76 feet, of the spire 140.</p>
<p>Upon the south side of the church is a stone porch of early
Norman architecture.&nbsp; Its outward arch is circular, with
diagonal or zig-zag mouldings, the inner rib obtusely
pointed.&nbsp; The small pointed windows on each side are curious
specimens of the very earliest rudiments of the mullioned
window.&nbsp; The ceiling also presents an example of the most
ancient kind of groined vault, and consists of four round massive
ribs crossing each other in the centre, without any boss or
ornament.&nbsp; The semicircular arch of the interior door is a
good specimen of the style of building in fashion from the
conquest to the days of Henry II.&nbsp; The north door is an
elegant example of this ancient kind of building.&nbsp; Formerly
it was an unsightly wooden porch, which was removed in
1801.&nbsp; <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>The arches of the north and south doors of the transept
are in the same early style.&nbsp; The decorations of the latter
are rather uncommon, having lozenge pannels placed alternately,
and each filled with an embossed flower.&nbsp; The side aisles,
with the upper story of the nave and choir, have pointed windows
with mullions, while those of the transept are long and lancet
shaped, without any.&nbsp; The higher walls of the nave were, in
the repair of 1786, very injudiciously raised some feet above
their original level, which altogether destroys the ancient
proportions, and gives the whole building a top-heavy
appearance.&nbsp; Formerly the church was crowned with pinnacles,
which issued from the spaces between each window and the corner
buttresses of the transept and choir, but now, excepting those on
the chapel, not one remains.</p>
<p>Within, the church is spacious, lofty, interesting, and from
its venerable and solemn appearance, admirably adapted to the
purposes of religious meditation.</p>
<blockquote><p>As chanced, the portal of the sacred pile<br />
Stood open, and we entered.&nbsp; On my frame,<br />
At such transition from the fervid air,<br />
A grateful coolness fell, that seem&rsquo;d to strike<br />
The heart, in concert with that temperate awe<br />
And natural reverence which the place inspired.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Wordsworth</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The walls of the nave are supported on each side by four
semicircular arches, with moulding peculiar to the pointed style,
and these spring from finely clustered pillars, their shafts
having the small flat rib which belongs to the 13th
century.&nbsp; The capitals are highly enriched with foliage,
and, as is usual in ancient churches, are all of different
designs.&nbsp; Above the arches is a clere-story, with a high
range of short windows on both sides, running the whole length of
the church.&nbsp; These are irregularly ranged in couplets, <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>and have
heads very obtusely pointed, each divided by a single
mullion.&nbsp; The ceiling of the nave, which is of oak, rises
into an extremely flat arch, separated by its principal beams
into square pannels, including circles richly adorned with
quatrefoils and foliage.&nbsp; The ribs and bosses at their
intersections, are carved, with double roses, devices and knots;
those attached to the centre beam having pendant ornaments,
pelicans, angels with musical instruments, and grotesque
sculptures.&nbsp; The chancel is considerably elevated by two
ascents of steps.&nbsp; On each side is a pointed arch, blocked
up, resting upon imposts similar to the clustered pillars in the
nave.&nbsp; Several</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash; marble monuments are here displayed<br />
Upon the walls: and on the floor beneath<br />
Sepulchral stones appear, with emblems graven<br />
And foot-worn epitaphs, and some with small<br />
And shining effigies of brass inlaid,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>belonging to the Lyster, Morhall, Lloyd, Gardner, and Sandford
families.&nbsp; On the north side, near the altar, is a beautiful
triple window, with arches remarkably sharp pointed, the centre
rising much higher than those of each side and supported upon
slender insulated columns, whose capitals are adorned with
foliage, busts, and grotesque heads.&nbsp; The ceiling of oak
pannelling, was in this part quite plain.&nbsp; The interstices
between the beams have been plastered over and painted with
trefoil and other appropriate enrichments, and the intersections
adorned with carved roses and devices, collected from the ruins
of St. Chad&rsquo;s and St. Alkmond&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In the
chancel, is an altar tomb, upon which is a recumbent figure of a
cross legged knight, in linked armour, the sides adorned with
rich foliated niches, once containing figures.&nbsp; This
monument is supposed <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>to belong to John de Leyborne, of
Berwick Leyborne, last of the family.&nbsp; In the vestry, under
a low pointed arch, is a plain altar tomb, which has formerly
been ornamented with shields; on the massy alabaster slab which
covers it, are engraven the figures of a man in armour,
bareheaded, with his wife, both in the act of prayer.&nbsp; From
the inscription which is somewhat defaced, we learn, that it was
erected to &mdash; Stafford and Catherine his wife, in
1463.&nbsp; In the transept and nave there are some singular
monumental figures, brought here from the ruins of St.
Chad&rsquo;s and St. Alkmond&rsquo;s, but to whom they belonged
has not been ascertained.</p>
<p>The lower divisions of the great window which terminates the
chancel, is occupied by some ancient painted glass brought from
old St. Chad&rsquo;s, representing the root of Jesse: the arch or
head is made up with ancient coats of arms and modern stained
glass.&nbsp; The altar piece is a rich Grecian design.&nbsp; The
altar is a fine slab of Sienna marble bordered with jasper, and
was the gift of the Rev. Hugh Owen, vicar of St. Julian&rsquo;s,
when curate here in 1789.&nbsp; In the gallery at the west end of
the nave, is a very handsome organ, made by John Harris and John
Byfield, and as this church, with the exception of St. Lawrence,
at Ludlow, is the handsomest in the county, so the organ with a
like exception, is the most powerful and best toned.&nbsp; In the
tower is a musical peal of ten bells, the harmony of which is not
exceeded by that of any other peal in the town.</p>
<p>On the south-west side of the church-yard is a tomb-stone
erected to the memory of Thomas Anderson, a lieutenant in
Ligonier&rsquo;s regiment of light horse, who was tried at
Worcester for desertion, in the first German war of George II.
and removed here for execution.&nbsp; He was shot on Kingsland,
near <a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>this
town, on the 11th of December, 1752, and met his fate with
calmness and fortitude.&nbsp; At the foot of the tower is a stone
in memory of Robert Cadman, who in January, 1740, in an attempt
to descend from the top of the spire by means of a rope affixed
to it, the other end of which was placed in the fields on the
opposite side of the river, fell lifeless in St. Mary&rsquo;s
Friars, through the breaking of the rope, amidst an immense
number of spectators.&nbsp; The inscription is quaint:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Let this small monument record the name<br />
Of Cadman, and to future times proclaim,<br />
How from a bold attempt to fly from this high spire,<br />
Across the Sabrine stream, he did acquire<br />
His fatal end: &rsquo;Twas not for want of skill<br />
Or courage to perform the task, he fell,<br />
No, no, a faulty cord being drawn too tight,<br />
Hurried his soul on high to take her flight,<br />
Which bid the body here beneath, good night.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The right of presentation to this living is vested in the
Corporation of Shrewsbury at large; and in the choice of a
minister, (who must at least be a M.A.) the son of a burgess who
has been brought up at the Free Schools; or one born in the
parish of Chirbury, is to have the preference.&nbsp; The church
is a royal peculiar, the Official having cognizance of all
ecclesiastical matters arising within the parish and its
subordinate chapelries.&nbsp; He is stiled &ldquo;Ordinary and
Official, Principal of the peculiar and exempt jurisdiction of
the Free Royal Chapel of the Blessed Virgin Mary.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The present minister, who is also official, is the Rev. John
Brickdale Blakeway, M.A.&mdash;Organist, Mr. Thomas Tomlins.</p>
<h4>St. Julian&rsquo;s Church,</h4>
<p>Situated at the top of Wyle Cop, originally of Saxon election,
is a plain substantial structure of brick and <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>stone,
rebuilt in 1750, at an expense of &pound;2000.&nbsp; At the west
end is the square tower of the old church; the lower part being
of red stone and in a more ancient style than the higher story,
which is of the 16th century.&nbsp; It is furnished with six
bells.&nbsp; In the east wall of the chancel is a small female
figure within a foliated tabernacle, preserved from the reins of
the old church, and probably representing St. Juliana, the
patroness.</p>
<p>The form of this church is an oblong square, 83ft. by 48ft.
the roof being supported by four Doric columns on each
side.&nbsp; The ceiling is ornamented with the fret work of the
old church.&nbsp; The altar-piece is adorned with Ionic
pilasters, supporting a rich cornice and architrave.&nbsp; The
east window is filled with fine painted glass, consisting chiefly
of a large ancient figure of St. James, bearing the Scriptures in
his hand, purchased in 1804, from the splendid collection of
glass brought from Rouen, in Normandy, during the French
Revolution, and is extremely well executed.&nbsp; Above the
Apostle are escutcheons of the arms of France and England,
quarterly, and those of the corporation, and see of
Lichfield.&nbsp; The arms of the present and ancient patrons of
the church, Earl Tankerville, Sir John Astley, and Prince,
together with those of the families of Rocke, Powys, Bowdler,
&amp;c. &amp;c. are exhibited in various situations in the
edifice, which is likewise beautified with a variety of painted
and stained glass.&nbsp; The only ancient monument in this church
which is worthy the attention of the antiquarian, is a slab of
coarse alabaster, lately removed from the church-yard into the
chancel.&nbsp; It is nearly a foot in thickness and as hard as
flint; and besides a modern epitaph which has been inserted in
the centre of it, it contains round the edge this inscription, in
Longobardic capitals, now nearly obliterated, <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>but capable
of being read, EASMONYND TROVMWYN GIST ICI DIEV DE SA ALME EN EYT
MERCI AMEN. i.e. Edmund Trowmwyn lieth here, may God have mercy
on his soul.&nbsp; Amen.</p>
<p>There is an organ in the gallery.</p>
<p>The Earl of Tankerville is the patron.&nbsp; The present
incumbent is the Rev. Hugh Owen, F.A.S.&nbsp; Archdeacon of
Salop, portionary of Bampton, Oxfordshire, and prebendary of
Salisbury.</p>
<h4>Old St. Chad&rsquo;s Church</h4>
<p>Is situated at the top of Belmont.</p>
<p>This once venerable pile was founded previous to the Norman
conquest, by one of the kings of Mercia, soon after the expulsion
of the Britons, on a site of a palace belonging to one of the
princes of Powis, which was destroyed during the wars between the
Britons and their Saxon invaders.&nbsp; In 1393, a considerable
part of the structure was burnt down through the carelessness of
a plumber, then repairing the lead on the roof, who, frightened
at beholding the edifice in flames, endeavoured to escape over
the ford of the Severn, near the eastern gate, but was drowned in
the attempt.&nbsp; In the early part of the year 1788, the church
was observed to be decaying fast, and a respectable architect,
who was employed to survey it, advised that the tower should be
taken down, in order to relieve the mouldering pillars of their
vast weight.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this salutary advice was not
acted upon; in lieu thereof, partial repairs were undertaken, and
the attempt to remove a shattered pillar, that a firmer one might
be erected in its place, completed its ruin.&nbsp; On the second
day after the workmen had commenced their destructive operations,
the decayed pillar gave way, and in consequence, the <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>tower fell
about four o&rsquo;clock the following morning, July 9, 1788, on
the roof of the church, and overwhelmed the greater part of the
sacred edifice in ruinous desolation.</p>
<p>About a month previous to this occurrence, the church had been
thronged with thousands, who had assembled to witness the
interment of an officer with military honours.</p>
<p>Although a considerable part of old building remained, it was
not deemed advisable to rebuild the church on its ancient
site.&nbsp; The present fragment of it, which was formerly the
Bishop&rsquo;s chancel, was fitted up for the purpose of
performing the rites of sepulture in, and at this time it is used
as a charity school.</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark, that the light of the reformation
first dawned in Shrewsbury in this church.</p>
<h4>St. Alkmond&rsquo;s Church,</h4>
<p>Situate immediately adjoining St. Julian&rsquo;s, was
originally founded by Elfrida, daughter of Offa, king of Mercia;
and like some others in Shrewsbury, was erected at different
periods and in different styles of architecture in the form of a
cross.&nbsp; At the destruction of St. Chad&rsquo;s church, the
parishioners, alarmed for the safety of their ancient structure,
caused it to be thoroughly examined, and in consequence of some
symptoms of decay exhibited in the roof, they determined on the
demolition of the old church and the erection of a new one on a
part of its site.&nbsp; The present building was accordingly
opened for divine worship in November, 1795, at an expence of
about &pound;3000, one half of which might have been saved by a
judicious repair of the original erection, and thus preserved for
ages.&nbsp; The beautiful spire-steeple at the west end, is the
only part which escaped the general <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>devastation.&nbsp; It is 184 feet in
height, and is highly ornamental to the town, especially when
seen from the adjacent country.&nbsp; It contains a musical peal
of eight bells.</p>
<p>The plan of the church is an oblong square, 84 feet by 44,
with a small recess for the altar, over which is a handsome
painted window, by Eginton; the subject is emblematical of Faith,
kneeling on a cross, with the eyes elevated and arms extended
towards a celestial crown which appears amidst the opening
clouds.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be faithful unto death, and I will give thee
a crown of life,&rdquo; is the motto.</p>
<p>Previous to the demolition of the old church, there were a
variety of ancient inscriptions, few of which are now
visible.&nbsp; In the church-yard is a monument to the memory of
Alderman William Jones and his wife, the former of whom died in
1612.&nbsp; It formerly stood in the chantry north of the
chancel; and about sixteen years ago it was munificently repaired
by the late Sir Thomas Tyrwhit Jones, Bart, M.P. the worthy and
respected representative of the family.</p>
<p>The living is in the gift of the crown.&nbsp; Its present
incumbent the Rev. J. Wightman.</p>
<h4>St. Giles&rsquo;s Church,</h4>
<p>Of the origin of which no authentic account is known, stands
at the eastern extremity of the Abbey Foregate, and bears marks
of considerable antiquity.&nbsp; By some it has been thought to
be the earliest parochial foundation in Shrewsbury; but others,
with more semblance of truth, give the palm in this respect to
the Abbey, to which St. Giles&rsquo;s is now attached, merely as
a convenience for the performance of funeral ceremonies; public
worship being only celebrated within its walls, twice every
year.</p>
<p><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>It is a
small plain building, consisting of a nave, chancel, and north
aisle, with a small turret for the reception of a bell.&nbsp; Its
interior presents several varieties of architecture, whilst its
antique and worm-eaten benches, its homely pavement, and its
almost altogether unadorned state, combine to give it a simply
interesting appearance.</p>
<p>The church-yard contains the tombs of various inhabitants of
the town; among others is one raised to the memory of Cheney
Hart, M.D. a native of Warrington, and an eminent physician of
this town for thirty-three years, on the pedestal of which,
crowned with a handsome urn is a Latin inscription.&nbsp; On the
north side the yard is a tomb in memory of William Congreve, esq.
formerly lieutenant-colonel of the 17th foot, and his relict
Jane.&nbsp; This gentleman was a descendant of the ancient family
which gave birth to our celebrated dramatic writer, while his
lady, a Waller, was sprung from that of elegant poet of
Beaconsfield.&nbsp; The grave stone of William White, who was a
quarter-master of horse in the reign of William III. bears the
following lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>In Irish wars I fought for England&rsquo;s
glory;<br />
Let no man scoff at telling of the story:<br />
I saw great Schomberg fall, likewise the brave St. Ruth,<br />
And here I come to die, not there in my youth.<br />
Thro&rsquo; dangers great I&rsquo;ve passed many a storm;<br />
Die we must all as sure as we are born.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><i>PROTESTANT DISSENTERS</i>.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is always painful to men of
sober and moderate principles, to recur to the Act of Uniformity,
which in Bartholomew&rsquo;s day, 1662, drove from their livings
at least 2000 clergymen, &ldquo;many of them distinguished <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>by their
abilities and zeal,&rdquo; to seek subsistence from the charity
of friends, and consolation in times of oppression from the calm
testimony of a good conscience.&nbsp; To this act however,
Shrewsbury is indebted for its first regular dissenting
church.&nbsp; The place where they assembled is called</p>
<h5>The Presbyterian Chapel.</h5>
<p>This congregation was founded by Mr. Bryan and Mr. Tallents,
the ministers ejected from St. Chad&rsquo;s and St.
Mary&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It was destroyed in 1715, by a mob, soon
after the accession of the House of Hanover, and was rebuilt by
government.&nbsp; It stands on the north side of the High Street,
and is a plain building of brick, neatly fitted up.&nbsp; It is
now used by a respectable congregation of Unitarian
Dissenters.&nbsp; Minister, the Rev. G. Case.</p>
<p>In the year 1766, a disagreement took place among the
congregation frequenting the Presbyterian chapel, relative to the
choice of a minister, in consequence of which, they separated,
and a part of them erected a new chapel.&nbsp; It is called</p>
<h5>The Independent Chapel,</h5>
<p>Situate on Swan Hill, and is a commodious brick erection of an
oblong form.&nbsp; It has a numerous and very respectable
society.&nbsp; On the north side is a vestry.&nbsp; A neat stone
tablet on the front bears the following inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">THIS BUILDING WAS ERECTED</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">IN THE YEAR 1767,</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">FOR THE PUBLIC WORSHIP OF GOD</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">AND IN DEFENCE OF THE</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">RIGHTS OF MAJORITIES</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">IN PROTESTANT DISSENTING
CONGREGATIONS</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN MINISTERS.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Minister, the Rev. T. Weaver.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>The
Methodist Chapel,</h5>
<p>Called also St. John&rsquo;s Chapel, is situate on St.
John&rsquo;s Hill, and previous to the erection of a house in
front of part of it, was a great ornament to the street.&nbsp; It
is a neat and extensive brick building of an oblong form, and is
calculated to accommodate a large congregation.&nbsp; Behind the
chapel is a vestry, in which are placed the stairs leading to the
pulpit, which in consequence, has rather a novel appearance to a
stranger, no steps being visible in the chapel.&nbsp; The
congregation is numerous and respectable.</p>
<h5>The Baptist Chapel</h5>
<p>Is in Dog Lane; with a well-finished interior, it is, perhaps,
from the awkward situation of the pulpit and its extreme lowness,
one of the most unpleasant chapels in the town, especially when
crowded, which is often the case on particular occasions.&nbsp;
It is a plain respectable brick building, and has a numerous
congregation.&nbsp; The Baptists were established here in
1780.</p>
<h5>The Quaker&rsquo;s or Friends Meeting House</h5>
<p>Is situate on St. John&rsquo;s Hill, and, like the respectable
body who assemble within its walls, is a plain unadorned
building.</p>
<p>The SANDEMANIANS and WELSH METHODISTS, also have Chapels in
Hill&rsquo;s Lane; and the ROMAN CATHOLICS a neat one near the
Town Walls at the back of the Lion Inn.</p>
<h3><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>CHARITABLE ERECTIONS &amp; INSTITUTIONS.</h3>
<h4>The Free Schools.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">Education</span> is, in the British
empire, an object of national concern.&nbsp; Our various
universities and public schools are splendid monuments of the
attention paid by our ancestors to the important object of
training and enlightening the youthful mind.&nbsp; The provision
made for the support of these establishments, especially in
England and Ireland, is, generally speaking, munificent.&nbsp; At
the same time, it is not sufficient to afford a temptation to the
indulgence of idleness, by the conversion of respectable offices
into sinecures.&nbsp; The dignity hence accruing to their
teachers and professors, invests them with high authority, and
imparts additional weight to their instructions; while the
respect in which they are habitually held by long established
prescription, gives a powerful sanction to the system of their
discipline.</p>
<p>This observation applies with peculiar force to the munificent
edifice of the Royal Free School of King Edward VI. which is
situate at the northern extremity of Castle Street.&nbsp; Its
erection was completed in 1630, the ancient school-room, which
was composed of timber, having been removed in order to the
completion of the present spacious and convenient structure of
free-stone.&nbsp; The building surrounds two sides of the court
with a square pinnacled tower in the angle.&nbsp; In the centre
of the front is a gateway, adorned on each side with a Corinthian
column, very rudely designed, upon which stand the statues of a
scholar and a graduate, bareheaded, and in the dress of the <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>times.&nbsp;
Over the arch is a Greek sentence from Isocrates,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align:
center">&rsquo;&Epsilon;&#8048;&#957; &#8134;&sigmaf;
&phi;&iota;&lambda;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;&theta;&#8052;&sigmaf;
&#7956;&sigma;&#8131;
&pi;&omicron;&lambda;&upsilon;&mu;&alpha;&theta;&#942;&sigmaf;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Importing that a love of literature is necessary to the
formation of a scholar.&nbsp; Above are the arms of Charles
I.&nbsp; The ground floor on one side the gateway, contains a
room originally used as an accidence school; on the other the
third master&rsquo;s house, now given to the head master, who
places his assistant in it.&nbsp; In the middle story are
comprised the lodging rooms of the assistant&rsquo;s house, and
the lower master&rsquo;s apartment, which for many years has been
converted into a writing school.&nbsp; The principal school room,
which occupies the upper story, is 80 feet by 21.</p>
<p>The chapel is on the ground floor of the other part of the
building, and is divided from the anti-chapel by a handsome open
screen of oak, richly embellished with grotesque carving, as are
the pulpit and bible stand.&nbsp; The ceiling is adorned with a
variety of foliage, devices, and rebusses, preserved from the
ruins of St. Alkmond&rsquo;s Church.&nbsp; The arms of the first
and present masters are placed along the middle.&nbsp; Prayers
are read here twice on school days, by the head master, who is
chaplain and catechist, for which he has a distinct salary of
&pound;20 a year.</p>
<p>Over the chapel, and of the same size, is the library, which
contains a most valuable collection of books, and in size and
decoration is in no respect inferior to the majority of those in
the Universities.&nbsp; A half length of Henry VIII. and his son
Edward VI. when a boy; a full length of an Admiral in the dress
of Charles II. reign, probably Benbow, together with five
portraits of head masters, ornament the walls.&nbsp; In this room
are also preserved three sepulchral stones discovered at
Wroxeter.</p>
<p><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>A small
museum is separated from the lower end of the room, in which are
some Roman antiquities, chiefly from Wroxeter, with a few fossils
and other natural curiosities.&nbsp; Among the latter, is the
dried body of a sturgeon, caught in 1802, in a weir adjoining the
island, a quarter of a mile below the castle.&nbsp; When alive,
it weighed 192 pounds, and was 9 feet long and 3 feet 4 inches
round.</p>
<p>In front of the schools on the town side, is a play ground
enclosed from the street by iron railing, and a considerable
piece of ground is used for a similar purpose at the back, which
opens to the country and is entirely secluded from the
town.&nbsp; Two large houses most delightfully situated
contiguous, belong to the masters, with every accommodation for
boarders.&nbsp; The revenues are very handsome, and are derived
chiefly from the tithes of a number of townships in the parishes
of St. Mary and St. Chad, and the whole rectory of Chirbury,
which were granted by King Edward VI. and Queen Elizabeth.</p>
<p>This seminary has been long celebrated for the erudition of
its scholars.&nbsp; Under the &ldquo;excellent and worthie&rdquo;
Thomas Ashton, it flourished eminently.&nbsp; At one period he
had 290 pupils, among whom we notice Sir Henry Sydney, whose son,
the heroic Sir Philip Sydney, laid here the seeds of that
exemplary friendship with the celebrated Sir Fulk Greville, Lord
Brook, which he maintained through the whole of his short but
splendid career.&nbsp; Beside these, the noted Jeffries, Lord
Chief Justices Jones and Price; Drs. Bowers and Thomas, Bishops
of Chichester and Salisbury; the Rev. John Taylor, L.L.D. and the
celebrated Dr. Waring, received their education here.&nbsp; Nor
does the present character of the school fall short of that
distinguished pre-eminence which it formerly sustained.&nbsp;
Under the judicious direction of the <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>learned Dr. Butler, it is in a
flourishing state.&nbsp; Not only do the children of the
principal families in the adjacent counties and North Wales,
receive the rudiments of their learning here, but also those of
many families of distinction from distant parts of the
empire.&nbsp; The appointment of master rests solely in the
fellows of St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge; that of ushers
and the mode of instruction is vested in the head master.</p>
<h4>The House of Industry.</h4>
<p>This handsome brick building, situated on the opposite side of
the river to the Quarry, was erected in 1765, as a Foundling
Hospital, at an expence of &pound;12,000.&nbsp; Numbers of
children were sent here from London, and placed out at nurse
during their infancy with the neighbouring cottagers, under the
superintendance of the surrounding gentry.&nbsp; When arrived at
a proper age, they were brought into this house and employed in
various branches of a woollen manufactory, and afterwards
apprenticed to various individuals.&nbsp; About 1774, however,
the governors finding their funds inadequate to the support of
the charity, the house was shut up; and a few years after was
rented by government, who in the American war used it as a place
of confinement for Dutch prisoners.</p>
<p>In 1784, an act of parliament was obtained to incorporate the
five parishes of Shrewsbury and Meole Brace, as far as related to
their poor, and to erect a general House of Industry.&nbsp; The
governors of the Foundling Charity were glad of an opportunity to
dispose of their erection at a considerably reduced rate, and the
building was accordingly purchased, together with about twenty
acres of land, for about &pound;5,500, and it was opened for the
reception of paupers <a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>in December in that year.&nbsp; For a
short period they were employed in the fabrication of woollen
cloths, but this being found injurious to the pecuniary resources
of the house, it was discontinued, and at present their
employment chiefly consists in manufacturing the various articles
of their clothing.&nbsp; They breakfast, dine, and sup in the
dining hall, a very long room, the men, women, boys and girls,
being each placed at separate tables.&nbsp; Divine service is
performed twice each Sunday, in a neat chapel parallel with the
hall.&nbsp; There is also an infirmary, where the sick and infirm
are lodged in proper wards, and attended to by nurses and the
apothecary belonging to the house.&nbsp; The whole is under the
management of twelve directors, chosen from persons assessed in
the associated parishes at &pound;15. or possessed of property to
the amount of &pound;30. per ann. who appoint a governor and
matron, to superintend the domestic economy of the
establishment.</p>
<p>Mr. Nield, the worthy disciple of the philanthropic Howard,
remarks of this place, which he visited in 1807, &ldquo;This
House of Industry is certainly a house of plenty, for the books
every where, bear record of good living, and the famous beef
slaughtered here.&nbsp; The average number in the house is 340;
the children delicate and pampered, from being accustomed to
abundance and variety of provisions, and comfortable rooms, very
dissimilar to the hardy peasant, and therefore ill calculated to
rear up useful assistances in the employments of agriculture, or
to make useful servants in this agricultural county.&nbsp; They
would prefer a race of hardy lads, inured from their infancy to
combat weather and temporary want; whose nerves are strong by
early exertions, and their understandings furnished with some
knowledge of rural life.&rdquo;&mdash;<a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>Mr. Nield&rsquo;s extensive
observation and experience, qualified him to judge of the most
proper aliment and employment of this class of persons, far
better than most of the directors and governors of similar
institutions can reasonably be expected to do; and as indulgence
and plenty cannot be supposed to be the portion of the children
of the poor in their progress through life, we may indulge a hope
that the directors will speedily devise some plan for the
initiation of their young dependants into habits of judicious
labour and healthy abstinence.</p>
<p>Along the north front of the house is a beautiful gravel walk,
from whence the town is seen to great advantage.&nbsp; On the
right, the Abbey-foregate, with its two venerable churches,
various manufactories, Lord Hill&rsquo;s Column, and a great
extent of fertile land, are seen backed by the Wrekin, Haughmond
Hill, &amp;c.&nbsp; In front, the river Severn flowing close
underneath, the beautiful verdure of the quarry, and the town,
present themselves; whilst on the left are descried a large
portion of this extremely fertile county, together with the
distant Montgomeryshire and Denbighshire hills.&nbsp; This
extensive prospect over the neighbouring country, with the
endless variety of scenes that present themselves to the
spectator are finely described in the following lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ever charming, ever new,<br />
When will the landscape tire the view?<br />
The fountain&rsquo;s fall, the river&rsquo;s flow,<br />
The wooded vallies warm and low;<br />
The windy summits wild and high<br />
Roughly rushing on the sky!<br />
The pleasing seat, the ruin&rsquo;d tow&rsquo;r,<br />
The naked rock, the shady bow&rsquo;r<br />
The town and village dome and farm<br />
Each give each a double charm,<br />
As pearls upon an Ethiop&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Dyer</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>It was
from this house, that the benevolent but eccentric Mr. Day,
deluded by the fascinating eloquence Rosseau, selected two girls
on whom to try an experiment on female education, in which he
proposed to unite the delicacy of a modern female, with the bold
simplicity of a Spartan virgin, which should despise the
frivolity and dissipation of the present corrupted age.</p>
<p>Having obtained the object of his wishes, he repaired with
them to France, taking no English servant, in order that they
might receive no ideas but those which he chose to instil.&nbsp;
After spending about eight months in France, he placed the one in
a respectable situation in London, and with his favourite
actually proceeded some years in the execution of his project;
but experience and mature reflection at length convinced him,
that his theory of education was impractible, and he renounced
all hope of moulding his protegee after the model his fancy had
formed.&nbsp; He therefore placed her in a boarding school at
Sutton Coldfield, in Warwickshire; and after completing her
education, she resided some years in Birmingham, and subsequently
at Newport, in this county: and by her amiable deportment secured
a large circle of friends.&nbsp; Mr. Day frequently corresponded
with her parentally.&nbsp; In her 26th year she married Mr.
Bicknell, a gentleman who accompanied Mr. D. to Shrewsbury, at
the commencement of this singular experiment.</p>
<h4>Salop Infirmary.</h4>
<p>This noble asylum, situated in St. Mary&rsquo;s Churchyard,
was formed in the memorable year 1745, for the accommodation and
relief of the diseased and indigent poor.&nbsp; The munificence
with which this excellent institution has been supported by the
inhabitants <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>of the county at large, has enabled its conductors to
proceed upon the most liberal principles.&nbsp; Admission is
given to the diseased from whatever quarter they may come,
provided they are recommended by a subscriber; but in case of
sudden accident, this recommendation is dispensed with.</p>
<p>It was opened in 1747, and has the honour of being one of the
earliest of similar erections, those of Bristol, Northampton,
Winchester, and Exeter, being the only provincial ones
established prior thereto.&nbsp; The building is of brick with a
stone portal, and the back windows, which look into the country,
command a varied and extensive prospect.&nbsp; Considered with
respect to its internal cleanliness and economical management,
and the humane and skilful attentions of the medical gentlemen of
the town, its advantages are such as will vie with those of any
similar provincial institution, and are calculated to excite in
the minds of the benevolent and reflecting, feelings of the most
compassionate regard and generous sensibility.</p>
<p>Since its foundation, &pound;126,671. 9<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>
in voluntary subscriptions and benefactions, has been contributed
for its maintenance and support.&nbsp; By the last report it
appears, that up to June 1822, 33,589 in-patients have been
received into the house, 18,373 have been cured, and 3,481
relieved; also 52,142 out-patients, of whom 37,720 have been
cured, and 4,877 relieved.</p>
<p>Besides the physicians and surgeons of the town who attend
gratuitously, a surgeon resides in the house, in order that
medical aid may not be wanting in cases of emergency.&nbsp; The
domestic economy is superintended by a matron.&nbsp; The
pecuniary concerns are managed by a secretary, under the
inspection of a Board of Directors and deputy Treasurer.&nbsp; A
Treasurer also is appointed annually from among the <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>subscribers
of five guineas and upwards, and on the Friday in the Shrewsbury
race week, a sermon is preached by the chaplain, and a collection
made for the benefit of the charity, the plates being held by two
ladies, supported by two gentlemen of distinguished rank or
opulence.&nbsp; The clergy of the established church, residing in
the town, officiate in rotation weekly; two of the subscribers
also resident in Shrewsbury, are weekly appointed as house
visitors.</p>
<h4>Millington&rsquo;s Hospital</h4>
<p>Stands in the suburb of Frankwell, and is so called from its
benevolent founder, the late Mr. James Millington, draper of
Shrewsbury, who in 1734, bequeathed nearly the whole of his
property to its erection.</p>
<p>The hospital is a respectable building of brick.&nbsp; Over
the pediment, in the centre, is a turret, in which is a
clock.&nbsp; In this part is a chapel, used also for a school
room, and houses for the master and mistress.&nbsp; On each side
are six small houses for the poor.</p>
<p>The will of Mr. Millington appointed a schoolmaster and
mistress, who have each a house and &pound;40. per annum, and the
master &pound;10. additional for keeping the accounts.&nbsp; A
chaplain, with a stipend of &pound;25.&nbsp; Twelve poor men or
women chosen from the single housekeepers of Frankwell, or the
part of St. Chad&rsquo;s parish nearest to it, to each of whom is
allotted an apartment in the hospital, consisting of two
comfortable rooms, a small garden, a gown or coat, given on St.
Thomas&rsquo;s day, a load of coals on All Saints&rsquo; day, and
an allowance of &pound;6. per annum.&nbsp; Gowns or coats and
40<i>s.</i> each, are also dispensed every year to ten poor
single housekeepers resident in Frankwell, and when a vacancy
happens in the hospital, the person <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>who has longest received the garments
is elected to it.&nbsp; The hospitallers and out-pensioners have
also two twopenny loaves weekly.&nbsp; Twenty poor boys and as
many poor girls, born in Frankwell, are completely clothed twice
annually, and receive their education in the hospital.&nbsp; When
arrived at the age of fourteen, the boys are apprenticed,
&pound;7. 10<i>s.</i> is given with each, and &pound;2.
10<i>s.</i> is expended in cloathing: &pound;5. is also presented
to those, who at the expiration of their first year&rsquo;s
apprenticeship, can bring a certificate of their good
behaviour.&nbsp; The girls are allowed &pound;5. on going out
apprentices.</p>
<p>Two exhibitions of &pound;40. a year each are founded for
students of St. Magdalen&rsquo;s College, Cambridge.&nbsp; Those
who have been originally scholars on the hospital foundation,
claim the preference, or one born in Frankwell, and educated in
the free grammar school is most eligible.</p>
<h4>Allatt&rsquo;s School</h4>
<p>Was erected in 1800, at the bottom of Swan Hill, pursuant to
the will of the late Mr. John Allatt, formerly chamberlain to the
corporation of Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>The structure is of free-stone, and contains two houses for
the master and mistress, connected with the school rooms by
arcades.&nbsp; It cost about &pound;2000, erected from a plan by
Mr. Haycock.&nbsp; The interest of the residue of Mr.
Allatt&rsquo;s property, maintains a schoolmaster and mistress,
and educates twenty poor boys, and as many girls, whose parents
have not received parochial relief.&nbsp; The children are taught
reading, writing, and arithmetic, and the girls sewing; they are
cloathed once a year, and at a proper age apprenticed.&nbsp;
Twenty coats and eighty good stuff gowns are also distributed
annually, to that number of poor old men and women.</p>
<h4><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>Bowler&rsquo;s School,</h4>
<p>In the Back Lane, near the Wyle Cop, is a plain brick
building, founded in 1724, pursuant to the will of Mr. Thomas
Bowdler, alderman and draper, for instructing, cloathing, and
apprenticing poor children, of the parish of St. Julian.&nbsp;
The dress is blue.</p>
<h4>Public Subscription Charity School</h4>
<p>Was erected near the Abbey church, in 1778.&nbsp; The
institution is supported by voluntary subscription, and children
from every part of the town, boys as well as girls are
admissible.&nbsp; The system of instruction pursued is that of
Dr. Bell, the master having a salary of &pound;40. and the
mistress &pound;30.&nbsp; The dress of the children is brown, and
hence it is sometimes called the brown school.&nbsp; The number
in the school at the date of the last report, June 1822, were,
boys 190&mdash;girls 150.</p>
<h4>Royal Lancasterian School.</h4>
<p>This edifice was built in 1812, in consequence of a lecture
delivered on the subject of Education, by the celebrated Joseph
Lancaster, at the Town Hall, in Shrewsbury.&nbsp; As its name
imports, the system of instruction is that of Mr.
Lancaster.&nbsp; There is one apartment for boys and one for
girls, to each of which children are admitted, on being
recommended by subscribers.&nbsp; It is supported by voluntary
subscriptions and donations.&nbsp; Number of boys 260; girls
217.</p>
<h4>St. Chad&rsquo;s Alms-Houses.</h4>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This yeare 1409, one Bennett Tupton, being
a common Beere Bruar, and dwellinge in St. Chadd&rsquo;s Churche
Yarde in Shrousberie, now called the Colledge, founded the
Almeshouses in the sayde <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>St. Chadd&rsquo;s Churche Yarde in
Shrousberie, beinge then a man at that tyme of 60 yeares of
age.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Originally they were 13 in number, but not having any funds,
two are fallen to decay.&nbsp; The present allowance to the poor
is about 16s. per annum, including 2<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> paid by
the company of mercers.</p>
<h4>St. Mary&rsquo;s Alms-Houses,</h4>
<p>Situate at the western end of St. Mary&rsquo;s church-yard,
were founded 1460, by Degory Watur, draper.&nbsp; They are 16 in
number, extremely wretched and filthy in appearance, and
dangerous and unwholesome from their smallness, each having only
a single apartment 11 feet by 8, without any outlet.&nbsp; The
centre house, originally inhabited by the founder, and called the
hall, is larger than the others, and has a wooden porch, on which
is a painting of Watur and his wife, and on the front is the
effigy of King Edward IV.&nbsp; The poor people, who must be
parishioners of St. Mary&rsquo;s, have each &pound;2. 6<i>s.</i>
10&frac12;<i>d.</i> allowed them annually, by quarterly payments
from the draper&rsquo;s company, and an upper garment once in two
years.</p>
<h4>St. Giles&rsquo; Alms-Houses,</h4>
<p>Near St. Giles&rsquo; church, in the Abbey Foregate.&nbsp; The
houses are four in number.&nbsp; The residents in them are
nominated by the earl of Tankerville, who allows them 1<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i> per week, with a quantity of coals and an upper
garment annually.</p>
<h4>Sick Man&rsquo;s Friend and Lying-In Charity.</h4>
<p>The objects of this Institution, which was begun in 1810, are
the relief of the diseased, and of poor <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>married women
in childbed, at their own houses; who not only receive medical
assistance, if necessary, but the use of bed linen, food and
every other necessary that their situation requires.&nbsp; The
meetings of the Committee are held at the Independent Chapel, on
Swan-hill.</p>
<h4>Samaritan Society &amp; Lying-In Charity,</h4>
<p>Is similar in its objects and institution to the former.&nbsp;
Its operations commenced in 1814, and the meetings of its
Committee are held in the vestry of St. John&rsquo;s Chapel.</p>
<h4>Ladies&rsquo; Charity,</h4>
<p>Was instituted in 1814, by some benevolent females, solely for
the purpose of assisting poor married women with cloathing, food,
and other necessaries requisite for their situation.&nbsp; The
meetings of the Committee are held in the vestry of St.
Chad&rsquo;s church.</p>
<p>The extensive scale on which the three last named charities
are conducted, and the liberality with which their benefits are
dispensed, to the deserving poor, place them among the first
charitable institutions which so much distinguish the town of
Shrewsbury.&nbsp; Their operations are confined to no sect or
party, and they design nothing but the purest philanthropy.&nbsp;
Their laudable plans are promoted by the individual exertions and
charitable subscriptions of the members, each of whom pay
2<i>s.</i> per quarter and upwards.&nbsp; The number of the
members is about 300.&nbsp; No public buildings are connected
with these praise-worthy establishments, the present mode of
relief being considered superior to those of an hospital.</p>
<h4>Shrewsbury General Sunday School</h4>
<p>Is held in the large room in the linen manufactory in
Coleham.&nbsp; The order and regularity observed in this <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>institution
has been noticed by strangers from distant parts of the
kingdom.&nbsp; Its numbers according to the last report were boys
215, girls 247.&nbsp; In addition to this, a separate room is
allotted to the instruction of Adult scholars, whose number is
44.&nbsp; The whole are taught reading and writing.</p>
<h4>Swan Hill Sunday School</h4>
<p>Is a similar institution and similarly conducted.&nbsp; The
number of scholars are, boys 96, girls 104.</p>
<p>Besides this, St. Chad&rsquo;s Boys Sunday School, has about
100 boys, under the superintendance of its committee.</p>
<h4>St. Mary&rsquo;s Sunday and Day School</h4>
<p>Is held in the chapel of St. Mary&rsquo;s church.&nbsp; The
children are taught reading and writing; their number is about
162.</p>
<h4>St. Chad&rsquo;s Ladies&rsquo; School.</h4>
<p>This is carried on in that part of St. Chad&rsquo;s old church
which escaped entire destruction.&nbsp; It is a most
praise-worthy establishment, and is superintended by many
respectable ladies of St. Chad&rsquo;s parish, who devote a
considerable portion of their time in furtherance of this object
of their anxious solicitude.</p>
<p>The latter institutions deserve the close inspection of the
benevolent and humane.&nbsp; The recurrence of stated days, on
which the well-ordered artizan and peasant, emerging from the
dirt and impurities of their vocations, to practice the virtue of
cleanliness, produces an easy association between a sense of
self-decency, and the reverence due to the service for which the
sabbath is set apart.&nbsp; To strengthen this <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>feeling and
principle, becomes therefore an important object to all those
interested in the good order, peace and happiness of the people
of the British empire; and to enfix it as deeply as possible, the
impression cannot be made too early.</p>
<h4>Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.</h4>
<p>In conjunction with this excellent institution, a District
Society has been established here for the purpose of co-operating
with the Society at Bartlett&rsquo;s Buildings, in the
distribution of Bibles, Testaments, Prayer Books, and other
religious books and tracts.&nbsp; The praise-worthy objects of
the Society are supported by some of the most respectable and
opulent residents in the county.&mdash;Secretary, the Rev.
Archdeacon Owen, M.A., F.A.S.</p>
<h4>Shropshire Bible Society</h4>
<p>An auxiliary Bible Society, to co-operate with the British and
Foreign Bible Society, in London, was instituted here on the 11th
of November, 1811.&nbsp; The late Rev. Francis Leighton,
explained to the meeting, summoned on this occasion, the nature
and objects of this charity.&nbsp; A number of liberal donations
were offered, and an extensive annual subscription entered
into.&nbsp; The important object of this society, as its name
imports, is, the gratuitous distribution of the scriptures among
the poor inhabitants, and also by its contributions, to aid the
noble design of the parent society in translating the Bible into
all languages which are represented by letters, and to circulate
them throughout the earth.&nbsp; The Rev. Archdeacon Corbett is
the president, and the annual meeting is held on the first
Wednesday in July.</p>
<h3><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>REMAINS OF ANCIENT BUILDINGS.</h3>
<h4>The Council House</h4>
<p>Received its name from having been the residence of the Court
of the Marches of Wales; for though their principal abode was at
Ludlow, they were accustomed to hold one term in the year at this
place, for the convenience of suitors, and another at Bewdley,
and sometimes at Hereford.</p>
<p>The house is in the immediate vicinity of the castle (in the
outer court of which, it is supposed to have been built,) on a
steep bank overhanging the river.&nbsp; The entrance to it from
the town is by a venerable timber gate-house, the ornaments of
which have lately been plastered over.&nbsp; The great hall and
chamber, which were the only apartments not <i>modernized</i>,
have just (1815) been pulled down and rebuilt, and the rich old
chimney-piece which stood in the hall, in the centre of which
were the arms of Owen of Condover, has been removed to that
venerable mansion.&nbsp; Charles I. kept his court here, as also
did James II. in 1687.</p>
<h4>St. Nicholas&rsquo;s Chapel</h4>
<p>Is still standing in part on the left hand entrance to the
council house, and is now used as a stable.&nbsp; The building
consisted of a nave and chancel without aisle; the former is
nearly perfect, and there is no doubt, but that its erection is
of great antiquity.&nbsp; The whole length is 50 feet, the
breadth 19 feet.</p>
<h4><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>Austin&rsquo;s Friars.</h4>
<p>The convent of the Eremites of St. Augustine, stood at the
bottom of Barker-Street <a name="citation89"></a><a
href="#footnote89" class="citation">[89]</a>, near the
river.&nbsp; A small part only remains, little of it being to be
seen excepting the shell of a large building of red stone, with
two pointed arched door ways.&nbsp; It is now used as a
tan-house.</p>
<h4>Franciscan Friary.</h4>
<p>The house of the Franciscan or Grey Friars, stood under the
Wyle Cop, on the banks of the Severn.&nbsp; A part of this friary
still remains, converted into houses.&nbsp; A large stone coffin
lies in the garden of an old timber house, erected soon after the
dissolution.</p>
<h4>Dominican Friary.</h4>
<p>Scarcely a fragment of this friary now remains.&nbsp; It is
supposed to have occupied nearly the whole of the meadow between
the Water-lane-gate and the English Bridge.</p>
<p>The lady of king Edward IV. twice lay in at this convent, and
was delivered of Richard and George Plantagenet.&nbsp; The former
perished in the tower with his unfortunate elder brother, in the
subsequent reign, by the machinations of his cruel uncle
Richard.&nbsp; Prince George died young.</p>
<h3><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>PLACES
OF AMUSEMENT.</h3>
<h4>The Theatre.</h4>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> building, if we may credit the
affirmation of Phillips, is part of the ancient palace of the
princes of Powisland; who in their frequent transactions with the
sovereigns of England, often resided at Shrewsbury.&nbsp; John de
Charlton, who married an heiress of the line of Powis, obtained a
license in 1308, to embattle this mansion, and hence it acquired
the name of Charlton Hall.&nbsp; In 1445, Henry Gray, Earl of
Tankerville and of Powis, granted the premises to Thomas Bromley;
from whom, twenty-five years after, they were demised to Nycholas
Warynge, of Salop, merchant of the staple of Calais.&nbsp; After
various changes and transfers, it became the property of the
Waring family.</p>
<p>The ancient boundary walls of this mansion, inclosed all the
space contained between Cross Hill, St. John&rsquo;s Hill,
Murivance, or Swan Hill, and Shoplache.&nbsp; The house doubtless
formed one, if not two quadrangles, which may still be
traced.&nbsp; The most considerable remnant is a building of red
stone, in length 100 feet, and in breadth 31 feet, which is the
present Theatre.&nbsp; The side next the street has been
plastered and washed with stone colour, to give it the semblance
of a modern front; but surely, nothing was ever so disgraceful to
the town as its present appearance, especially when considered as
a public building.&nbsp; The other side exhibits the original
walls with some blocked-up pointed arches, and other features of
high <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>antiquity.&nbsp; It is probable, that in the old
edifice, this part was the great chamber, appointed according to
the usage of the times, for receiving company, and occasionally
for exhibiting shows and interludes.&nbsp; The interior being now
fitted up as a modern Theatre, retains few of its original
appurtenances, except the remains of a small spiral stone
staircase.&nbsp; It consists of a pretty roomy pit, a ground tier
of boxes, with upper side boxes, and a tolerably spacious
gallery.&nbsp; The stage is well adapted to the size of the
place, and the decorations are in the usual style of provincial
playhouses.&nbsp; The same remark may apply to the performers,
who are, generally of that middling class, which consists of
persons in their first career to excellence, and of others that
have got half-way, and remain stationary.&nbsp; The taste of the
Salopians being rather of the retired kind, which delights most
in domestic society, does not contribute much to encourage
dramatic exhibitions, and the house is scarcely ever crowded,
except during the race week, and in the summer visits of the
London performers.&nbsp; The audiences, however, if not numerous,
are select; and it may be mentioned to their honour, that they
never tolerate any thing that borders on buffoonery and
indecorum.&nbsp; One of their most favourite plays, for obvious
reasons, is the first part of Henry IV. and when Jack Falstaff
talks of having fought Hotspur &ldquo;a full hour by Shrewsbury
clock,&rdquo; he never fails to draw down a thunder of
applause.</p>
<h4>Assembly Room.</h4>
<p>An elegant apartment erected for this polite amusement, at the
back of the Lion inn, and is extremely commodious, having a
gallery for the musicians at the northern end.&nbsp; The dancing
and card assemblies commence in the month of September, and are
held <a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>generally once a month.&nbsp; The town and neighbourhood
of Shrewsbury furnishing a variety of genteel society, they are
generally attended by a very numerous and respectable
company.&nbsp; They are supported by subscription.</p>
<h4>The Circus</h4>
<p>Is a spacious brick erection, near the Welsh Bridge.&nbsp; It
was built in 1821 by Mr. Newton, and as its name imports, is used
principally as a Theatre for the display of Equestrian
performances.&nbsp; It is spacious and commodious, and well
calculated for Pantomimical exhibitions.</p>
<h4>Races.</h4>
<p>The Horse Races continue for three days, and take place in the
month of September.&nbsp; On these days a great number of plates,
sweepstakes and matches are run for; the course is at Bicton
Heath, about two miles west of the town, where booths are erected
for the use of spectators.&nbsp; The gentlemen who are annually
appointed stewards, generally being persons of property and
influence, the races are well attended, not only by the
population of the neighbourhood, but also by many families of the
first respectability from distant parts of the kingdom.</p>
<h4>Fishing.</h4>
<p>The Severn is celebrated for the excellency of its salmon,
which was formerly in such abundance at Shrewsbury, that it was
made an article in the indentures of apprentices, that they were
not to be obliged to eat it oftener than two days in a
week.&nbsp; Of its superabundance the inhabitants cannot at least
now complain, little being to be purchased under 2s. 6d. per
pound, and that but seldom.</p>
<p><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>Besides
Salmon, the river Severn contains twenty-one other sorts of fish,
the chief of which are flounders, pike, trout, perch, eels, shad,
carp, lamperns, and lampreys.&nbsp; The two latter are found in
many other rivers, but none are so much valued as those taken out
of the Severn, from whence they are sent to many parts of
England.&nbsp; Lampreys are a delicious dish, but unwholesome if
eaten in great quantities: of which we have an instance in the
death of Henry I. who died in consequence of eating too
plentifully of this fish.</p>
<p>Nor is it in the Severn alone that the angler will find
amusement, Meole and Condover brooks affording excellent trout,
and the river Tern, a great variety of delicate fish.&nbsp; Each
of these streams are within a short distance of the town.</p>
<h4>Bowling Greens.</h4>
<p>Of this most healthful species of amusement Shrewsbury cannot
boast; however, the pleasant villages of Meole, distant one mile,
and Uffington, distant three miles and a half, furnish two very
excellent greens, and where the pedestrian will be well
accommodated and attended to, after the fatigues of his walk.</p>

supplies these fountains, rises at <i>Broadwell</i>, in a field
near Crow-Meole, about two miles from the town.&nbsp; The work of
conducting it to town in leaden pipes, was completed about 1574;
a reservoir was placed under a shop in the Butcher Row in 1743,
but was afterwards removed to Claremont Hill, and on the
demolition of the town-walls, for the purpose of erecting the new
church of St. Chad on its site, the lodge opposite the
Quarry-keeper&rsquo;s house, at the top of the centre walk of
that beautiful promenade, was built for this purpose.</p>
<h4>Severn Water.</h4>
<p>The reservoir for this water is in a large cistern near the
butter market, from whence it is conveyed to almost all the
inhabitants by means of lead pipes, for which they pay in
proportion to the quantity of water.&nbsp; The water is forced up
to this reservoir by means of a large wheel placed at the English
or East Bridge, but in consequence of the frequent fluctuations
<a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>of the
Severn, it is probable that six months out of the twelve, the
town is destitute of this supply, and whatever quantity may be
wanted for culinary and other purposes is carried from the
river.&nbsp; It is much to be wished, that the present waterworks
were removed, not only on account of the deformity which they
give to the noble appearance of the bridge; but the water which
is sent to the reservoir after running nearly round the town and
receiving all its filth, would by the removal of the works to
Cotton Hill, and the erection of a steam engine, be distributed
to the inhabitants in a more regular manner, and in a much purer
state.</p>
<h4>Baths.</h4>
<p>There are two cold baths, one in Kingsland and the other in
the suburb of Abbey Foregate, but neither of them can be
recommended as possessing suitable accommodations, especially
when compared with those of other places.</p>
<h4>The Quarry.</h4>
<p>This beautiful walk is on the western side of the town near
the church of St. Chad; it occupies a rich meadow of about twenty
acres gradually sloping to the river, and is supposed to have
obtained its name from a small quarry of soft red sand-stone,
which was formerly procured here, and with which some of the
ancient buildings were no doubt erected.&nbsp; The lower walk
which skirts the river, is 540 yards in length, shaded with lime
trees, planted by Henry Jenks, Esq. in the year of his mayoralty,
1719.&nbsp; Three walks lead from the town to that on the bank of
the Severn, and two others formerly crossed the entrance.</p>
<p>Few promenades in the kingdom can vie with the Quarry,
particularly in the spring of the year, when <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>it displays
all its pride of beauty.&nbsp; Its spacious fields carpeted with
grass, thickly studded with the golden hue of the butter cup, and
the silvery tinge of the modest daisy&mdash;its noble trees
clothed with leafy verdure of various hues, and protecting the
pedestrian from the piercing rays of the sun&mdash;the Severn
rolling its broad and majestic stream along&mdash;whilst the
feathered songsters carol their notes to the God of nature,
altogether present a lovely picture of rural happiness.&nbsp; Nor
is the Quarry at &ldquo;the fall of the leaf&rdquo; when nature
unburdens herself of her lovely mantle, unworthy the
contemplation of the reflecting mind.</p>
<blockquote><p>The fading foliage of th&rsquo; embrowning
grove,<br />
(Which oft has listened to the voice of love,)<br />
In mournful junction with the shortning day,<br />
Reminds us of the circling year&rsquo;s decay:<br />
While the fleet, whistling winds, dismantling, tear<br />
Each tree&rsquo;s green honours to the chilling air,<br />
Thence to descend, and in man&rsquo;s footsteps lie<br />
A just memento of mortality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the 16th century, it appears that Shrewsbury was the scene
of theatrical representations.&nbsp; Julian the apostate, was
performed here in 1565, and two years afterwards, the Passion of
Christ, to see which queen Elizabeth is said to have come as far
as Coventry, but on learning that its representation was over,
returned to London.&nbsp; The particular spot which formed the
rural theatre, was at the top of the rope walk in the
Quarry.&nbsp; The ground which forms a gentle acclivity, was cut
into the form of an amphitheatre, the seats of which may still be
traced in the bank.</p>
<p>Beside this, which is the chief walk, the town and
neighbourhood furnish such a variety of picturesque and pleasing
promenades as are equalled perhaps by few in the kingdom.</p>

97</span>MANUFACTORIES.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> Shrewsbury is not
distinguished by its spirit of commercial enterprise, its
contiguity to the Principality, the facilities which it possesses
for the importation and exportation of goods, by means of its
noble river and canals, and its situation as the capital of an
extensive and populous county, combine to give to it many
advantages over a variety of places equally insular.&nbsp; Its
fabrication of threads, linen cloths, &amp;c. &amp;c. stand
unrivalled; whilst the more common articles of domestic life are
executed in a stile of neatness, certainly equal, if not
superior, to those of any other place of similar size.&nbsp; The
following are the principal, which we can do little more than
enumerate.</p>
<p>Messrs. BENYONS&rsquo; MANUFACTORY is built on the north bank
of the Severn, near the prison.&nbsp; The articles manufactured
here consist of linen yarns, cloths, canvas, and threads.&nbsp;
The building was erected in 1804.&nbsp; The process of making the
various articles, is carried on by upwards of 400 hands, and the
whole machinery, which is of wonderful construction, is worked by
the solemn and stupendous action of a steam engine of 55 horse
power, which keeps in continual motion upwards of 3000
spindles.</p>
<p>A short distance from the former stands the FACTORY of Messrs.
MARSHALL and Co. who manufacture similar articles, the whole of
whose machinery is also worked by the powerful agency of
steam.</p>
<p><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>Of a
like description is that also of Mr. BAGE, in Coleham.&nbsp; The
other establishments are HAZLEDINE&rsquo;s, and GITTINS and
CARTWRIGHT&rsquo;s IRON FOUNDRIES, the BREWERY of JOHN HEATHCOTE
and Co.&mdash;the FLANNEL FACTORIES of Mr. BAKER and Mr.
RAMSBOTHAM&mdash;and Mr. HILL&rsquo;s SPIRIT DISTILLERY.</p>
<p>Nor will it be improper under this head, to mention some
others, which, although not strictly speaking, manufactures, do
honour to the town, and are worthy the early attention of
strangers.&nbsp; Among the first of these, may be named
BROCAS&rsquo;s CHINA and GLASS REPOSITORY, in the
Castle-street.&nbsp; The splendid collection here exhibited of
antique and foreign china, together with the no less beautiful
and admired specimens of the same article, from the first
manufactories of this kingdom, and the rich and superb display of
glass in an endless variety of patterns, as well for use as
ornament, cannot fail to prove a rich treat to the stranger.</p>
<p>BETTON and EVANS&rsquo;s STAINED GLASS MANUFACTORY, where
great improvements have been made in that beautiful art.&nbsp;
The perfection at which they have arrived, is truly astonishing,
and they have the merit of approaching nearest (and in some
colours even surpassing) the brilliant tints of the
ancients.&nbsp; That this eulogium is not undeserved, may be
ascertained by viewing the splendid windows executed by them for
Lichfield cathedral, as well as the specimens which may be
inspected at their warehouse on Wyle Cop.</p>
<p>The MARBLE ROOMS of Mr. CARLINE, sculptor, modeller, and
marble mason, Abbey Foregate; where a variety of marble
chimney-pieces are exhibited, in the Egyptian, Grecian, Gothic,
and <a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>modern
tastes, and in various species of the most beautiful foreign and
British marbles.&nbsp; Marble tables for halls, sideboards,
&amp;c. various figures in marble, bronze, artificial stone, to
support dials and lamps; statues, busts, &amp;c. of excellent
execution.</p>

100</span>MARKETS.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> markets of Shrewsbury are
plentifully supplied with the luxuries and conveniences of
life.&nbsp; They are held on Wednesdays and Saturdays.&nbsp; The
first is small; that on Saturday is, perhaps, not surpassed in
the display of eatables, by the market of any town of a similar
size in the kingdom.&nbsp; Butcher&rsquo;s meat is sold at the
single and double rows on Pride Hill, and at the Shambles in
Fish-street.&nbsp; Butter, Eggs, and Poultry of every description
at the Butter Market.&nbsp; The green market is held in the
square before the town-hall, where there is generally a luxuriant
supply of vegetables, and of extremely early production.&nbsp;
Wheat and all sorts of grain are disposed of in the
market-house.&nbsp; With milk the inhabitants are tolerably well
supplied by persons of the town who keep cows expressly for the
purpose; but &ldquo;art, ever jealous of nature, and benevolently
careful of the stomachs of the inhabitants, has, by the
application of a certain useful element, wisely deprived it of
its luxuriant richness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Fish market is well supplied.&nbsp; Not only the Severn
salmon, which is caught at their doors, but a very considerable
quantity of different descriptions of the finny tribe from Wales,
are regularly exposed for sale at tolerably moderate
prices.&nbsp; For its excellent brawn, Shrewsbury has long been
distinguished.</p>

105</span>Inland Navigation.</h4>
<p>The Severn has its source from a chalybeate spring on the
eastern side of Plinlimmon, a mountain in Montgomeryshire, in
North Wales, from whence rushing down with a swift current, and
being joined by many smaller torrents, it presently appears
considerable, and passing by Llanidloes and Newtown, becomes
navigable at Pool Quay, where the Vyrniew joins it with a stream
little inferior to its own; from thence proceeding gently forward
to Shrewsbury, which it surrounds nearly in the form of an
horseshoe, it flows on through a rich vale with many extensive
windings, till it comes to Benthall Edge, by the way receiving
into it the river Tern, which waters all the north of
Shropshire.&nbsp; Here the Severn begins to be rapid, being pent
up between two opposite hills, both very lofty and steep; and
from thence to Bridgnorth and Bewdley, the channel is confined by
high woody banks and rocky cliffs, which afford a variety of
beautiful prospects.&nbsp; Afterwards it again glides pleasantly
on through the fertile plains of Worcestershire, visiting in its
way the city itself, and a little below is considerably augmented
by the influx of the river Teme.&nbsp; This addition, however, is
much inferior to that which it receives from its junction with
the river Avon, at Tewkesbury.&nbsp; These two rivers thus
united, pursue their course to Gloucester, and about fifty miles
below that city are lost in the Bristol Channel.</p>
<p>This river, justly esteemed the second in Britain, is of great
importance, being navigated by vessels of large burden, more than
160 miles from the sea, without the assistance of any lock.&nbsp;
Upwards of 100,000 tons of coal are annually shipped from the
collieries about Madeley and Broseley, for the cities and towns
<a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>situate
on its banks, and thence conveyed into the adjacent
counties.&nbsp; Great quantities of grain, pig and bar iron, iron
manufactures, Coalport china and earthenware, as well as wool,
hops, cyder, and provisions, are likewise continually sent to
Bristol and other places, from whence various kinds of goods are
brought in return.&nbsp; In May, 1756, the number of Barges and
Trows on the river Severn navigating from Shrewsbury downwards to
Bristol amounted to 376, and since that time, by the addition of
the inland canals from the Trent, the Mersey and the Thames, into
the Stroud navigation, it may fairly be calculated that not less
than double that number are now employed.</p>
<h4>Shrewsbury Canal.</h4>
<p>This canal commences on the north-east side of Shrewsbury, and
winding with the Severn passes Uffington, where it runs parallel
with the river Tern and passes Upton Forge, Withington,
Roddington, where it crosses the river Roden, also the river
Tern, at Long Mill; passes Long, Eyton, crosses Ketley Brook at
Wrockwardine Wood, and there joins the Donnington Wood and the
Shropshire Canals.&nbsp; The total length is 17&frac12; miles;
with 147 feet rise in the five miles between Long and Wombridge;
the rest is level.&mdash;The principal use of this canal is the
conveyance of coals for the consumption of Shrewsbury and the
intermediate places, from the numerous coal works in the eastern
part of Shropshire, which furnish that article of an excellent
quality.&nbsp; The best are delivered in Shrewsbury at about 15s.

107</span><i>ENVIRONS OF THE TOWN</i>.</h2>
<h3>Sutton Spa.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Quitting</span> Shrewsbury by the suburb
of Coleham, and proceeding for about a mile along a narrow lane,
we reach Sutton Spa.&nbsp; Few countries in Europe can boast of
more medicinal or mineral waters than England, the virtues of
which have been well established, not from vulgar experience
only, but from the repeated examinations of the most skilful
physicians.&nbsp; The uncommon frequency of the healing springs
may rationally be attributed to the lixivious quality of our rain
water, to the variety of rich soils, with the spoils of which,
from their property of dissolving, they must be fraught, and to
the wonderful and inimitable chemistry of nature by which they
are so happily impregnated as to become the easiest and surest
remedies of the most grievous and otherwise incurable
diseases.</p>
<p>For the following account of this Spa the author is indebted
to a paper drawn up by Dr. Evans, (now of Llwynygroes,) and
inserted in the Agricultural Survey of Shropshire by the Rev.
Archdeacon Corbett:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sutton Spa is situated about two miles
south of Shrewsbury, on the slope of a gentle eminence, and close
to a village of the same name.&nbsp; The spring issues from a
rocky stratum of ash coloured clay, or argillaceous schistus,
containing (as appears by its effervescence with nitrous acid) a
small portion of lime.&nbsp; Fresh from the spring, the Sutton
water is clear and colourless, and exales a slightly sulphureous
smell; which is most perceptible in rainy weather.&nbsp; It
sparkles little when poured into a glass, having no <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span><i>uncombined</i> carbonic acid in its
composition.&nbsp; When first drawn its strong salt taste is
evidently mixed with a chalybeate flavour; but the latter is
wholly lost on exposure for a few hours, bubbles of air
separating slowly, and a reddish sediment lining the sides and
bottom of the vessel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sutton water has by many been compared with that of
Cheltenham, and supposed to contain nearly the same
ingredients.&nbsp; It bears, however, a much closer resemblance
to sea-water, and has accordingly been found most beneficial in
those cases for which sea-water is usually recommended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the case of scrophula, the superior merits of
sea-water has been uniformly and universally acknowledged.&nbsp;
A similarity of ingredients would naturally lead us to expect
similar effects from the Sutton water; and I am happy to bear
testimony, that a twenty years practice at the Salop Infirmary,
as well as in private practice, has furnished me with abundant
proofs of its success in the treatment of scrophulous affections;
and in addition to the properties possessed by the Sutton-spring
in common with sea-water, it enjoys one evident advantage in
containing iron. <a name="citation108"></a><a href="#footnote108"
class="citation">[108]</a></p>
<p><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>&ldquo;The air of Sutton, as might be expected from its
open elevated situation, is dry and wholesome.&nbsp; The site
commands a rich and highly variegated prospect, bounded on one
side by the magnificent group of Breyddin and Moel y Golfa, with
a long range of Welsh mountains rising in full majesty behind
them; and on the other by their no mean rivals, the Wrekin and
Stretton Hills.&nbsp; The view of Shrewsbury, betwixt the
branches of the adjoining wood, particularly when the setting sun
gilds every object with his mellowest light, is greatly and most
deservedly admired.&nbsp; The walk from Shrewsbury is pleasant
and picturesque; and the neighbourhood of a reasonable and
abundant market, can be considered as no trifling object, when
compared with the extravagant prices and scanty accommodations of
many of our remote watering-places.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the before-named estimable and respectable physician
drew up the account (about 1801) of the Spa, from which the above
is extracted, a neat cottage and baths for hot and cold bathing
have been erected by the noble proprietor, provided with
comfortable accommodations for invalids.&nbsp; We cannot help
thinking, that &ldquo;while almost every fishing village on the
coast is preparing conveniences for sea-bathing, how desirable
would it be to extend similar advantages to the interior parts of
the island, where poverty or infirmity render it impossible to
visit the distant sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The town is regained by a pleasant walk along the lane above
the Spa, which leads the tourist into the Abbey Foregate, very
near to the column erected in honour of Lord Hill.</p>
<h3><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>Shelton Oak,</h3>
<p>Stands about one mile and a half from Shrewsbury, just where
the Pool road diverges from that which leads to Oswestry.&nbsp;
This oak is remarkable, as well for its size as its traditional
history.&nbsp; Owen Glyndwr is said to have ascended it at the
battle of Shrewsbury to reconnoitre; but finding that the king
had a numerous army, and that Northumberland had not joined his
son Hotspur, he fell back to Oswestry, and, immediately after the
battle, retreated precipitately into Wales.</p>
<p>The tree is now in a complete state of decay, even its larger
ramifications; and within the hollow of it at bottom six persons
at least may sit down and partake of refreshment.</p>
<h3>Excursion to Haughmond Abbey and Uffington.</h3>
<p>The pedestrian may, in this walk proceed either along the
turnpike road or by the side of the river; we shall make choice,
however, of the former, on account of its facility for the
description of several interesting objects which present
themselves on the route.</p>
<p>Proceeding from the town through the suburb of Castle
Foregate, we leave the extensive linen factory of Messrs.
Marshall, and Co. on the left, the monotonous noise from the
machinery of which is very agreeably relieved by the pleasant and
extensive view that presents itself, in conjunction with the
bleaching fields belonging to Messrs. Benyons&rsquo; factory on
the right, and renders the prospect extremely interesting.&nbsp;
At the distance of one mile from the town, on the <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>left, is
the Old Heath.&nbsp; Previous to the erection of the present
excellent prison, all condemned malefactors expiated their
offences by the sacrifice of their lives to the offended laws of
their country in a field which adjoins the road at this
place.&nbsp; Continuing our jaunt to the turnpike, and keeping to
the right, at the distance of about 2&frac12; mites from
Shrewsbury we reach Sundorn Castle, the residence of Mrs.
Corbet.&nbsp; The landscape in travelling along this road is
exquisitely beautiful; rich corn fields and pastures demonstrate
the fertility of the soil, watered by the majestic stream of the
Severn, with a great number of rivulets which, descending from
the uplands, pour their tributary streams into that river; while
the pleasant seats and farm houses, thickly scattered through the
scene in contemplation, and surrounded by clumps of trees and
copse wood, satisfy the spectator that nature has not in this
neighbourhood lavished her treasures in vain.</p>
<p>The elegant mansion of Sundorn was erected in the castellated
style by the late John Corbet, Esq.: Its site in a beautiful
lawn, the venerable appearance of the castle, the sloping banks
which surround the large sheet of water covered with plantations,
the rich verdure of the adjoining woods, numerous corn fields and
pasture grounds tufted with trees, the hedgerows and walks
happily arranged, the bold appearance of the castle on the
adjoining hill, diversify the scene and render the <i>tout
ensemble</i> extremely interesting.</p>
<p>Within the demesne of Sundorn, the remains of Haughmond Abbey
are situated.&nbsp; Of the foundation of this once venerable pile
there is now no entire trace.&nbsp; Of the Abbey-church, nothing
remains but the south door of the nave, a most beautiful and
highly adorned round arch, resting on slender shafts, between
which on each side have been inserted a <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>Gothic
tabernacle, inclosing statues of St. Peter and St. Paul.&nbsp;
The chapter-house is entire; it is oblong, with the upper end
forming two sides of a hexagon.&nbsp; The roof is of fine oak,
and above has been another story.&nbsp; The entrance is by a
richly decorated round arch, with a window on each side, divided
into two round arched compartments, by slender short
pillars.&nbsp; The spaces between the shafts of these arches have
Gothic niches, and statues of the Virgin Mary, Gabriel, St.
Catherine, St. John, &amp;c.&nbsp; South of the chapter house,
and opposite the site of the church, are remains of the
Refectory, and beyond a large building, consisting of a spacious
hall, eighty-one feet by thirty-six, lighted by Gothic windows on
each side, and a large one, once filled with tracery, at the west
end.&nbsp; On the north side is a curious antique
fire-place.&nbsp; Communicating with this, at the eastern
extremity, and at right angles, is another apartment of nearly
the same size, once evidently in two rooms.&nbsp; At the south
end is an elegant bay window.&nbsp; It is conceived this building
formed the abbot&rsquo;s lodgings and hall.&nbsp; The situation
of the Abbey on a rising ground, backed by a noble distant
forest, commands a very rich and extensive view of the great
plain of Shrewsbury, with the town and castle, enriched by
mountainous tracts.</p>
<p>Proceeding from the Abbey along the bottom of the wood, and
ascending the hill, we reach a shooting box, erected in the form
of an ancient turret, by the late Mr. Corbet.&nbsp; Near it Lord
Douglas, in the battle of Shrewsbury, was taken prisoner, in
attempting to precipitate himself down the steep, when his horse
fell under him, and he received a severe contusion on the
knee.&nbsp; On reaching the summit of this hill, the traveller
will enjoy a beautiful prospect.&nbsp; His attention is lost in
variety; and his imagination for a <a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>while suspends its powers in
contemplating indiscriminately the vast but diversified
assemblage.&nbsp; In this situation he will recollect with
pleasure the animated lines of Thomson, whose descriptive genius
must continue to do honour to his country, as long as taste and
elegance are regarded.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Meantime you gain the height, from whose
fair brow<br />
The bursting prospect spreads immense around,<br />
And snatch&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er hill, and dale, and wood, and
lawn,<br />
And verdant fields, and darkening heath between,<br />
And villages embosom&rsquo;d soft in trees,<br />
And spiring towns, by surging columns mark&rsquo;d<br />
Of household smoke, your eye excursive roams,<br />
Wide stretching from the hall, <a name="citation113"></a><a
href="#footnote113" class="citation">[113]</a> in whose kind
haunt<br />
The hospitable genius lingers still,<br />
To where the broken landscape, by degrees<br />
Ascending, roughens into rigid hills.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The spectator, if he has any taste for the sublime and
beautiful in nature, will find himself abundantly repaid for the
labour of the ascent.&nbsp; His eyes will wander with pleasure
over the beautiful villas, the retreat of the rich and affluent,
diversified with woods and corn-fields, that present themselves
on the fertile plain adjoining the hill.&nbsp; Immediately before
him, he will discover the ancient town of Shrewsbury, with its
lofty spires, its noble river and canal, whilst in the distance a
range of green mountains, interspersed with woods, that seem to
be carelessly scattered on their sloping sides, form a suitable
background to this picturesque and interesting scene.</p>
<p>Descending from the hill, we immediately reach the pleasant
village of Uffington, situated on the banks of the Severn, where
at the Bowling Green excellent accommodations will be met
with.&nbsp; From <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>hence the canal and river side afford a pleasant walk,
which reconducts us to our starting place&mdash;Shrewsbury.</p>
<h3>Attingham Hall,</h3>
<p>Distant about four miles on the London road, is built of
beautiful free stone, and is situated in a very extensive lawn on
the banks of the river Tern, over which is a handsome bridge
erected by the late lord Berwick.&nbsp; The south front, which is
upwards of 365 feet in length, has an extremely grand appearance;
being decorated with lofty Ionic pilasters and a magnificent
portico.&nbsp; The interior of the house has much to recommend
it, particularly its lofty and spacious hall, the entablature of
which is supported by Verd Antique Scaglioni columns, with
statuary capitals and bases.&nbsp; The picture gallery is a
spacious room 78 feet 6 inches long, by 25 feet 6 inches wide,
and 24 feet high.&nbsp; It contains many <i>chef
d&rsquo;&oelig;uvres</i> of the old masters, particularly some
valuable ones by Raffaello&mdash;Parmigiano&mdash;Paolo
Veronese&mdash;Annibal
Caracci&mdash;Rubens&mdash;Vandyck&mdash;Poussin&mdash;Kuyp&mdash;the
Ostade&rsquo;s&mdash;Murillo&mdash;Salvator
Rosa&mdash;Berchem.&nbsp; The walls of this elegant room are of a
deep lake colour; the ceiling supported by porphyry columns of
the Corinthian order, the capitals and bases of which are
beautifully gilded.&nbsp; Underneath the cornice of this
extensive room is a gold fringe of great depth.&nbsp; The floor
is inlaid with rich Mosaic work, and the grand staircase is
finished in a corresponding style of magnificence.&nbsp; The
suite of drawing rooms is superbly furnished with immense plate
glasses and burnished gold furniture, and the ceilings are richly
gilt.&nbsp; The boudoir is a beautiful small circular room, the
pannels of which are decorated by the pencil of one of <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>our first
artists.&nbsp; The library is in the west wing, and is a very
extensive and lofty room, the cornice is supported by rich
Corinthian pilasters; and besides a very valuable collection of
books, it contains several rare specimens of sculpture from the
antique.&nbsp; Among those most worthy notice is a font <a
name="citation115"></a><a href="#footnote115"
class="citation">[115]</a> from Hadrian&rsquo;s Villa; on the
basso relievo on its exterior the story of Narcissus is
beautifully told.&nbsp; A rich candelabra from the antique, of
exquisite workmanship, near ten feet high&mdash;a fine colossal
statue of Apollo Belvidere&mdash;a beautiful
Esculapius&mdash;with a splendid collection of Etruscan vases
from Herculaneum, busts, chimeras, &amp;c. &amp;c.&nbsp; The
rooms on the first floor correspond in the grandeur and
magnificence of their furniture with those on the ground
floor.</p>
<p>The house was built originally from a design by Mr. Stewart,
but it has lately undergone a very extensive alteration, under
the superintendance of Mr. Nash; the rich and costly carvings and
ornamental furniture, were executed by Mr. Donaldson, of
Shrewsbury, whose correct taste in that fine art is too well
appreciated to need any eulogium here.</p>
<p>The situation of the house is healthy and delightful; and the
grounds contiguous thereto have lately been much improved.&nbsp;
The view of this elegant seat, from the public road near the
before-mentioned bridge has a fine effect: its beautiful
front&mdash;the extensive shrubberies&mdash;with the park richly
clothed with fine timber on the back ground, rising to a
considerable height above the mansion; whilst in the distance on
<a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>the left
will be seen the pleasing village of Atcham&mdash;its parish
church&mdash;and bridge, present, even to the passing stranger, a
very pleasing scene.&nbsp; The gardens, walks and pleasure
grounds, are laid out with taste, and display some very fine
scenery.</p>
<h3>Hawkstone,</h3>
<p>The seat of the noble and celebrated family of the Hills, is
situated on the eastern border of the county, about 14 miles from
Salop, and though with regard to the surrounding country it may
be said to stand on an extensive plain, it in itself consists of
a group of prominent and astonishingly romantic rocks, forming by
far one of the most attractive features, not only of this, but
perhaps, taken altogether, of any other county.&nbsp; To attempt
a particular or even a general description, would very far exceed
the limits of our whole book, as a cursory inspection of its
wonders occupies a walk of several days.&nbsp; General Paoli, who
visited this place before the late improvements, publicly
declared that in all his extensive travels, not even excepting
Italy or Switzerland, there were some scenes here that surpassed
in grandeur any thing he had seen.&mdash;A slight notice of some
of its principal beauties will best become our humble efforts in
so limited a work.&nbsp; The house, though spacious and elegant,
and not of very ancient erection, notwithstanding it is
embellished with some fine specimens of sculpture and painting,
forms but a small part of what is sought after here; the
attractive powers of Hawkstone consisting entirely in the
enchantment of the surrounding scenery.&nbsp; Three or four
massive rocks irregularly grouped, with their fine wooded sides
disclosing at intervals abrupt crags, towers, and shelving
precipices, with intermediate vallies of <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>still
seclusion and spreading lawns of verdant freshness, together with
many a broad expanse of park, studded with luxuriant trees either
grouped in groves, or single in feathery fullness, the whole
enlivened by inhabitants appropriate, picture to the sight both
at once and successively&mdash;scenes only equalled and seldom
surpassed, even in the poetic regions of luxuriant
romance.&mdash;The Grotto is approached through a stupendous
natural chasm of great length, and narrowing till but one person
at a time can pass, while over head the sky is just seen at a
great height; a dark cavern is then passed, and the sky is again
for a moment seen, when entering another cavern of complete
darkness and gradual ascent, the grotto is, after considerable,
though perfectly safe wandering, entered: the first appearance of
this spacious cavern is truly sublime, as it is seen by the
glimmering light of variously stained glass, throwing its lurid
and sepulchral faintness on the massive pillars, till at length
the grotto is entered with all its brilliance: It consists of a
very extensive excavation, finely fretted to its termination with
a profusion of rich petrifactions, shells, and marine
productions.&nbsp; In one of its awful recesses, through an iron
grate, is seen the figure of a British Druid, in complete
costume, passing amid the massy pillars, in a dim and green
light.&mdash;After various windings, a door suddenly opens in the
summit of the precipice, where, over the shelving rocks below,
and far above the highest forests, a scene of magnificence bursts
on the eye exceeding almost conception.&nbsp; This height is with
some difficulty descended by innumerable winding steps cut in the
solid rock.</p>
<p>A <span class="smcap">Scene</span> in <span
class="smcap">Switzerland</span> is presented here on the heathy
summit of one of the mountains, where a narrow plank bridge
crosses a deep chasm, and connects two rocks of terrific height
and cragginess.</p>
<p><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>The
terrace formed on the ridge of one of the hills, finely wooded,
is terminated by an octagon summer-house, that commands a
prospect of astonishing extent, from whence the bordering
mountains of Wales, with parts of no less than 13 counties, are
distinctly enumerated.&mdash;Near this place is a Column, 112
feet high, surmounted with a colossal statue of sir Rowland Hill,
the first protestant lord mayor of London, in 1550, the 3rd year
of Edward VI.&nbsp; In a most romantic glen, near this place, is
an Urn, erected by the late sir Richard Hill, purporting that it
was the hiding-place of one of his ancestors, during the civil
wars of Edward I. while his house was ravaged by the parliament
soldiers; but that his son speedily came to his assistance: the
approach to and from it now is much facilitated, without
destroying the wildness of the scene, by extensive passages and
steps.&nbsp; Beyond this is a well-stocked Menagerie of living
Animals, principally birds.&mdash;From hence, round the sudden
and abrupt corner of a rock, and through the cleft body of an old
oak, is entered one of the sweetest vallies imagination can tint,
and most properly called <span class="smcap">Elysium</span>: It
is bounded completely by wooded and inaccessible rocks, and can
only be entered at this narrow passage, or at the extreme
termination of its extent, about half a mile.&mdash;On the most
western of this group of rocks are the remains of <span
class="smcap">Red Castle</span>, built in the reign of Henry
III., though it is mentioned by this name in a grant as ancient
as William the Conqueror.&nbsp; It is now in awful ruins; but
lofty fragments of its walls form some of the most picturesque
beauties of this romantic place; and fling on the mind, if such
scenes needed it, the additional charm of that strange feeling
that antiquity and fallen grandeur never fail to excite.&nbsp;
Amid these towers is a well of surprising depth; called now the
<span class="smcap">Giant&rsquo;s </span><a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span><span
class="smcap">Well</span>.&nbsp; The site of this castle is
ascended and descended (as is usual amid most of the strange
scenes here) by steps cut in the rocks; and very frequently
through caverns, sometimes natural, but always surprising.&nbsp;
At the bottom of one of these is suddenly seen a Lion in his den,
which, though assuredly a trifling toy amid such scenery, never
fails to astonish the generality of visitors.&mdash;Here is also
a <span class="smcap">Scene</span> in <span
class="smcap">Otaheite</span>, consisting chiefly of a Hut, built
exactly on the model of what our lamented countryman, Captain
Cook witnessed in that happy island, and ornamented accordingly:
the scene wherein it is erected first pointed out the
propriety.</p>
<p>To enumerate, much more to describe, all, or even the
principal attractions of this wonderful place, would, as we
before stated, very far exceed the limits we have allotted
thereunto: yet before we close, as we would willingly please
readers of every description, it may not be amiss to notice what
is not improperly called <span class="smcap">Neptune&rsquo;s
Whim</span>, a spot no doubt most largely applauded by the
generality of visitors here.&nbsp; It is very properly detached
at a tolerable distance from the principal scenery of Hawkstone;
and consists of a cottage ornamented with shell-work and cinders,
amid ponds of fish; behind which is a mighty figure of the marine
god, with a profuse current gushing through his urn; he is
accompanied, of course, by his Tritons and Nereids, spouting
water through their leaden shells.&nbsp; This is acknowledgedly
<i>a whim</i> of his godship, whereof he partakes with mortals;
nor can these trifles, or even some of the inscriptions, tend to
lessen the august grandeur of this most magnificent spot, wherein
art has had little more to do than clear a path, for the votaries
of nature to have access to her most sportive and astonishing
charms.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>What skill,
what force divine,<br />
Deep felt in these appear! a simple train,<br />
Yet so delightful mix&rsquo;d, with such kind art,<br />
Such beauty and beneficence combin&rsquo;d;<br />
Shade, unperceiv&rsquo;d, so softening into shade;<br />
And all so forming an harmonious whole;<br />
That as they still succeed they ravish still.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Thomson</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the entrance to the Park is erected a very handsome and
commodious Inn, capacious enough for the reception of a number of
families; many of which frequently spend a considerable part of
the summer in this delightful spot.&nbsp; The attention of the
worthy host and the excellence of the accommodations, provisions
and wines, must be experienced to be duly appreciated.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
